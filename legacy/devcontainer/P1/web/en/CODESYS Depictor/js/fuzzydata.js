You have this viewer when you install the unlicensed CODESYS Depictor . For editing, you need a licensed version of the CODESYS Depictor Editor . The editor also provides a library with base POUs. In CODESYS , you can add 3D models as CODESYS Depictor objects to the POU pool or below the device application. To do this, click Add Object → Depictor . Then you can link the objects to your application in an interface with IEC variables so that the animation of the 3D model is independent of any applications. CODESYS -wide settings for the CODESYS Depictor are located in the CODESYS options. Using CODESYS allows for virtual functional tests of your physical IEC application and a descriptive display of functional dependencies.

Coordinate system (2), Draw coordinate system (3): When you select this option for a pose, the coordinate system for the position and transformation is displayed continuously, regardless of the selection in the tree structure. Publish pose : This option is available for objects in the POU pool only. When the option is activated, the pose appears immediately in all elements that reference the Depictor object. You can modify the pose individually and include your own elements below it. Button Animate (5): Animates all transformations of the pose in the defined order in the 3D view. The values defined in the Value column are incremented within one second from 0 or 1 to the next reached value. In this way, it is easy to see how each transformation affects the model in the 3D view. Transformations (4): In the following table, you find all translations of the pose in the order of execution (top to bottom). Parameter column (6): Transformation type with its properties Value \/Variable column (7): Value, variable, or expression that describes the respective transformation property. In offline mode, the CODESYS Depictor attempts to evaluate the expression directly and determine a value. In online mode, the expression is evaluated live. If an expression cannot be evaluated (offline or online) or it is empty, then the CODESYS Depictor attempts to use a previously determined value and finally uses 0 (or FALSE ). You can edit the Value \/Variable column. Numeric values are permitted, in addition to variables and IEC expressions from combinations of both (example: \" q + p*2 + 5 \"). For expressions, you can use global IEC variables or variables from the interface of the associated Depictor object in the POU pool. In the context menu of a selected transformation, commands are available for Move Up or Move Down within the table, as well as copy or remove. An additional transformation can be added at the end of the table: Double-click to add new transformation (8). A list box provides the possible transformation types: Translation (X\/Y\/Z) X-Rotation Y-Rotation Z-Rotation Scaling (X\/Y\/Z) Combined (structure): Instead of using the specific X\/Y\/Z-parameters, translation and rotation are combined by specifying a structured variable. For this purpose, you can define a structure with the frame variables X , Y , Z , Pitch , Yaw , and Roll . As an alternative, you can use the DepictorFrame structure from the DepictorBase library. See the following example for this: Connection : This transformation type is used for creating an element that is stretched in space between two points and its movements should be adapted automatically. For example, this is a robot arm that is moved in and out dynamically. For this purpose, you only have to specify the positions of both limited spatial points and a direction vector. Then the CODESYS Depictor calculates the pose for the connection element and scales it automatically. The following values are specified in the pose properties. They define its own coordinate system for the connection line inserted below the pose in the tree. Origin position: Position X , Position Y , Position Z Target position: Target X , Target Y , Target Z Direction: Up X , Up Y , Up Z (Up vector) See the following example for this: Trace (9): These properties are used for defining whether and how the motion path of TCP is drawn. Expression : Expression or constant ( 0 : no path drawn; 1 : draw path; 2 : delete path) Line width : Line width of the drawn path Color : Color of the path drawn Example of a combined transformation with structure DepictorFrame TYPE DepictorFrame :\nSTRUCT\n X : LREAL;\n Y : LREAL;\n Z : LREAL;\n Yaw : LREAL;\n Pitch : LREAL;\n Roll : LREAL;\nEND_STRUCT\nEND_TYPE\n\nPROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n rCount : LREAL;\n depFram : DepictorBase.DepictorFrame;\nEND_VAR\n\nrCount := rCount + 0.01;\ndepFram.X := COS(rCount)*4;\ndepFram.Y := SIN(rCount)*4;\ndepFram.Z := COS(rCount) * SIN(rCount) * 4;\ndepFram.Yaw := rCount*4;\ndepFram.Pitch := rCount*8;\ndepFram.Roll := rCount*12; Entry in the editor: configuration table Transformations of the pose, type Combined , column Variable\/Value : PLC_PRG.depFram See the following images for the configuration of a combined transformation above the structure (left) and the equivalent configuration above the individual parameters for translation and rotation (right): Example of displaying a transformation of type \"Connection\" The CODESYS Depictor should display the movements of a telescopic cylinder. The movement in space and the change in the length of the cylinder should be adapted automatically to the current position of two points in space. For this purpose, you use the transformation type \"Connection\" for the cylinder pose and specify both spatial points and a direction vector. Then the constantly required translation for the cylinder is calculated automatically by CODESYS Depictor . You create a \" Cylinder \" element below a pose in the Tree of the Depictor object (1). The element is then a Depictor reference from a library. Configure the Cylinder element in the Properties view (2) as follows: In the Basic tab (2), set the transformation (3): In the Appearance tab (4), set the color (5): Then configure the pose for Cylinder in the Properties\/Transformations view (3) as follows: Control a movement of the Depictor object by means of the application program Application, PLC_PRG PROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n lrRun : LREAL;\n\n lrX1 : LREAL := 0;\n lrY1 : LREAL;\n lrZ1 : LREAL;\n\n lrX2 : LREAL := 2;\n lrY2 : LREAL;\n lrZ2 : LREAL;\n\nEND_VAR lrRun := lrRun + 0.01;\n\nlrX1 := COS(lrRun)*2;\nlrX2 := SIN(lrRun)*2 + 2;\n\nlrY1 := SIN(lrRun*2)*3;\nlrY2 := COS(lrRun*2)*3;\n\nlrZ1 := COS(lrRun\/2);\nlrZ2 := SIN(lrRun\/2); " },

This array describes defined camera positions of the object. The number of camera positions in the array is defined by the variable uiNumberOfCameraPosition of type UINT . Using these implicit variables, you can control the camera with the IEC code.

For this, also see below: Example of the 3D view, bird's eye view, and lighting configuration . As in the 3D view, you can move the mouse to change the viewing angles of the entire scene. However, the camera position always remains on the Z-axis of the scene. Zooming only changes the distance from the camera to the center. When you select the Show the light radius in the bird's eye view option in the Lighting view for a light source, the lighted area is displayed as a yellow circle. " },

By configuring the lighting view (3), the scene also gets three light sources (5) that can be seen as yellow objects in the bird's eye view. The radii (4) of the light sources are displayed as yellow overlapping circles around the object in the bird’s eye view. The camera is shown as a gray conical object in the bird’s eye view. The shadowed circular area with the arrow axis in the 3D view is also in the bird's eye view, and the object is also drawn as a frame model. This helps to detect the current viewing direction of the camera on the object in both views. " },
