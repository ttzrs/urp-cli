"body" : "Smartphones integrate numerous sensors such as Hall effects, accelerometers, and GPS sensors. Using CODESYS Sensor App​ for Android , the data from the most common sensors can be sent from Android-based devices to a CODESYS controller via a network connection. Moreover, you can use the speech recognition of Android to send the recognized words as a string to the controller. In this way, you can implement a simple voice control with your Android device (for example, a smartphone) when an Internet connection is available. The software package contains a sample project for the CODESYS Development System which allows sent data to be displayed in a visualization. " },
