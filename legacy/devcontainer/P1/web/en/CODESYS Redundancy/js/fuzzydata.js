"body" : "Redundant control system You can increase the reliability of your control system by safeguarding your PLC with a redundant PLC. The redundant PLC is able to take over the application execution at runtime. This can prevent system failures, for example. The illustration shows the structure of a redundant control system. The application runs simultaneously on two PLCs: one active PLC (1) and the second PLC in standby mode (2). The PLC in standby mode reads the inputs of the connected fieldbus system (EtherCAT in the illustration) and synchronizes with the active PLC via the redundancy link (3). This allows the standby PLC to immediately become active in the case of a malfunction and to take over the control of the fieldbuses (4) without interruption. The redundancy interconnection (3) is implemented with TCP and UDP, but can be replaced by a vendor-specific component. Moreover, you can use visualizations with the redundant control system when they will run as CODESYS WebVisu in a browser. The visualization clients will continue to run almost seamlessly in the event of a switchover. Basic information about functionality The application programmer downloads the application to the first PLC and creates a boot application. The second PLC is synchronized when booted and receives the boot application. The boot application is loaded and initialized and then it is ready to execute the first task cycle. All data from the registered memory areas (all IEC data) is transferred to the second PLC. This means that redundancy is effective and the application task is executed synchronously on both PLCs. The synchronization of the task execution is implemented by messages which are sent via the redundancy interconnection. The messages are sent before and after the IEC task is executed. There is no preferred active PLC. The operating mode is determined by the boot sequence. The first PLC to boot sends a corresponding message via the redundancy interconnection. If it does not receive a response, then it loads the boot application and runs in standalone mode. If a message from the active PLC is not received by the standby PLC within the configured time, then the standby PLC assumes that the active PLC is no longer working. As a result, the standby PLC switches to standalone mode and now controls the fieldbus I\/Os. The active PLC also switches to standalone mode if it has not received a message from the standby PLC within the configured time. If the first PLC is replaced and restarted, then it synchronizes with the other PLC currently in standalone mode as described above and therefore goes into standby mode. A standby PLC can be switched to simulation mode. Redundancy is then not activated, but the fieldbus remains deactivated as in standby mode. The active PLC switches to stand-alone mode. Simulation mode can be ended by resynchronizing or restarting the PLC. The PLC then switches back to standby mode, unless errors occur during synchronization or restart. If errors occur during the update of the boot application or the registered memory areas, or during the redundancy cycle, the PLC is switched to error mode. It must then be resynchronized or restarted. \"Redundancy using the example of two Raspberry Pis with CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL\" The video is intended to give you a general overview of this feature. The range of functions of CODESYS Redundancy as seen there may deviate from the current range of functions. Sample project for redundant PLCs " },

"body" : "CODESYS version The same version of the runtime system has to be installed on both devices because the boot project is transferred between the PLCs and therefore has to be loadable on the second PLC. Task and communication in real time Only cyclical tasks are permitted. Tasks of type Event , Status , or Freewheeling cannot be synchronized. The CODESYS Redundancy functionality synchronizes exactly one task ( Redundancy Task ). Other tasks and applications are possible, but they run non-synchronized on both PLCs. Moreover, the redundancy system which affects the task execution and communication has to fulfill certain real-time demands: The runtime of the messages (request and response) of the redundancy communication has to exist within a previously defined time interval and the task jitter has to be considered. Real-time task execution means that the application task that is controlled by redundancy has a limited jitter. Real-time communication means that a message that is sent by means of the redundancy linking has to be received by the other PLC within a specific time. Task execution time The messaging duration (time for request and response) increases the execution time of the task: the total execution time of the task is longer when redundancy is used. Changing the names of the application and the task Changing the names of the redundant application or the redundant task is a significant change and is not possible during redundant mode. This is because, after a change, you need to reconfigure both PLCs as described in \"Getting Started\" under \"Configuring the redundancy system\". Value for timeout The value which you specify for the timeout has to be greater than the sum of the task jitter time and the maximum communication jitter time. Both times are system-specific. At runtime, when the task jitter is high and the message transfer is delayed, a timeout occurs. While waiting for a message from the other PLC, the system assumes that the other PLC is not running anymore. As a result, the waiting PLC and the sending PLC switch to standalone mode. That leads to synchronization losses and to communication problems on the fieldbus. You define the timeout when the active PLC switches to standalone mode in the Redundancy Configuration editor, on the General tab of the Redundancy Settings tab. Moreover, the value is stored in the runtime configuration file (example: CODESYSControl.cfg ) with the entry StandbyWaitTime . IEC timer Different execution times on both PLCs can cause \"bumps\" (deviating output values) when switching PLCs. To prevent this, the IEC timer values are frozen during the execution of an IEC task. Calls from IEC timers (example: the function TON ) when executing an IEC task therefore always lead to the same timer values, even if the physical time continues to run. Therefore, implementations should wait inactively (possibly in a loop). This is because IEC timer values do not change in the current task scan. Pointers, References, and Interfaces The POINTER TO , REFERENCE TO , and INTERFACE statements (and interface instances) for expressing relationships between application units do not work with synchronized redundant applications. POINTER variables must not be declared in data areas that are controlled by redundancy. This is because redundantly controlled data is transmitted to the other PLC during synchronization. However, pointers are not valid on the other PLC because another memory layout may be located there. When compiling, the redundancy feature checks that a pointer is located in a redundantly controlled area. A warning is displayed for each pointer found there. The check can be deactivated in the device description file with the following entry: <Device>\n <Custom>\n <Redundancy DisablePointerChecks=\"true\"> EtherCAT DC This redundancy extension is intended more for the process industry than for factory automation. For this reason, EtherCAT drives with distributed clocks are not supported. However, EtherCAT I\/Os are supported. See also the section \"Task and communication in real time\" above. \"Map on Existing\": Mapping to existing variables The I\/O mapping method \"Map on Existing” (mapping I\/Os to existing variables) is not recommended for use with CODESYS Redundancy . These kinds of variables are not stored in the input or output data areas, but where they are declared. As a result, they are not synchronized during operation. Network variables Network variables with write access must not be used because multiple write telegrams are sent at the same time. Network variables with read access are permitted. File access File access must not be used because different file data can cause \"bumps\" on the different PLCs when they are switched. If you use files, then you need to declare file handles in the data areas which are not subjected to redundancy control. The files have to be opened separately on both PLCs. The file handle of another PLC must not be used to access files on the local PC. When compiling, CODESYS Redundancy checks that handle variables ( RTS_IEC_HANDLE , CAA.HANDLE ) are located in a redundantly controlled area. A warning is issued for each handle variable which is detected in such an area. Online security user management If an online security user management is used, then you need to configure both PLCs with the same user name and password. Otherwise, online services such as write variable or online change are not transmitted to the standby PLC. SoftMotion CODESYS SoftMotion and CODESYS Redundancy cannot be combined. The time demands of SoftMotion cannot be fulfilled when using redundancy. " },

Application Redundancy task name Name of the task that is synchronized between both devices Only this one task is synchronized. Example: MainTask The task name is also entered in the RTS configuration file when you click the Write button. Alternatively, you could also manually edit the file. Timeout (ms) Time span to wait for the response from the active PLC After that, the standby PLC switches to standalone mode. In this case, the task execution is delayed by this time span. Example: 50 Recommendation: Set the value higher than the maximum task jitter time plus the maximum transmission time for redundancy messages. The setting is also stored in the RTS configuration file ( StandbyWaitTime ). When you deploy the CIFX-DP adapter, set the timeout to 100 ms in order to remain in sync in case of a reset. Synchronization timeout (ms) Time span to wait during a synchronization. After this period of time, the standby PLC switches to standalone mode. You can set the value optimally if you first determine the required synchronization time after getting a system trace from the PLC. See the Record the needed sync time in system trace option below. Example: 100 If the synchronization takes longer than the timeout is allowed in Timeout (ms) , and the jitter of PLC 1 is acceptable, then you can use this setting. Then the time span until the response has to be received is extended by this value. Increase this setting in step-by-step when you encounter these kinds of synchronization problems. The logger message Synchronization terminated after x ms because of SyncWaitTime refers to this situation. A redundant system switches to the synchronization phase for the start of the redundant PLC, a download, an online change, and the synchronization by means of user commands. During the synchronization phase, the task cycle time of the active PLC can be longer.

"body" : "Visualization The tab contains the configuration for the connection from one ore more CODESYS WebVisu clients to a redundant control system with two PLCs. If at runtime the active PLC fails, then the execution of the control application is taken over by the PLC previously in standby mode. The switching process takes place smoothly and therefore almost unnoticed by the connected visualization clients. Similar configurations are also possible based on a CODESYS HMI when these are run redundantly. Activate : Enables a redundant connection between the visualization clients and the web servers of the synchronous PLCs for a redundant control system The task configuration is extended by the IEC task VISU_REDUNDANCY_TASK . The VisuRedundancy library is integrated in the Library Manager. The Switchover references input field is available for the communication settings. Switchover references Use redundancy link configuration : The communication settings which have been configured on the Redundancy Link tab are used. This kind of configuration is possible when the web clients access over the same network interface as the redundancy link. : The address settings of the following (now enabled) input fields are used for the connections of the web clients.

Security Secure communication : The Ethernet connections from the visualization client to PLC 1 and PLC 2 are encrypted with TLS. Generate certificates Opens the Security Screen editor There you can create and manage certificates. View certificates Opens the View Certificate editor There you get information about the certificates installed on the respective PLC. Timeout Recommendation: As long as there are no synchronization problems between the redundant devices for the visualization, the default values of the timeouts should not be changed. If problems occur, then the communication line may be too slow. Then try to improve the stability by increasing the values for the timeouts. The visualization redundancy is based on a network connection which is used to exchange data between the active PLC and the standby PLC. This kind of data can be notifications about the creation of a new web visualization client or the change of a visualization within the web visualization. To prevent communication from being blocked in the event of communication problems, the following timeouts can be configured: Receiving timeout (ms) Time after which the receiving of data is canceled. When this time is exceeded, transmitted data (such as a notification about the creation of a new Webvisu client) can be discarded. Default: 5000 Transmission timeout (ms) Time after which the sending of data is canceled. When this time is exceeded, transmitted data (such as a notification about the creation of a new Webvisu client) is discarded. Default: 10000 Options Seamless download Can be enabled for HMI devices : Also after a download, the selected visualization and frame combination remain in the web visualization clients. As a consequence, the process does not start from the start visualization. Advanced : Enables the Advanced settings input field You should have to change the following advanced settings only in the case of special demands. Advanced Settings Command repetitions Number of repetitions of a command in case of an error The default value is 3. It is advisable to use a value >= 2. Heartbeat time (ms) Time to determine how often the \"Heartbeat\" command, which keeps the connection active, is transmitted 0 = The command is not used. If no data is transmitted on the Ethernet connection, then the connection terminates and the first next command returns an error. To prevent this situation, a \"Heartbeat\" command is sent. The resource usage of this command is extremely low. Use this function only in the case of a high error rate. Connection timeout: Line break detected (ms) Time after which a connection failure is considered to be a \"line break\" The standby device is unable to detect whether the absence of data is caused by missing commands or a problem with the connection. Therefore, it is necessary to reactivate the connections and to reset the connection if possible. The default value is 3000. It is advisable to use a value >= 2000. Client connection setup timeout (ms) Latency for the active connection This is the time spent to determine whether or not the connection is active. The default value is 2000. A value in the range of 500–3000 is usually okay. WebVisu connection timeout (ms) Timeout for web visualization clients in order to determine the switchover to another PLC The value represents a balance between the stability and the time until the connection problem is detected. This time is used by the clients which are connected to the active device to detect when the device is no longer active. If no data is received beyond this time, then the switchover to the other device is performed. The length of this time determines how fast the switchover is: a value which is too low can cause unnecessary switchover attempts in the case of a bad connection. A value which is too high delays the detection of a physical real device failure on the client side. The default value is 2000. " },

The redundancy area types can be assigned only to variables of POUs of type PROGRAM or of type Global Variable List , and are then valid for all variables of the object.
