A PROFIBUS network consists of one or more masters and multiple slaves with modules. In this network, the CODESYS runtime system can be employed as a master or slave device. Below a master (1), you can insert one or more slaves (2) with modules. Below the slave device (3), you can insert I\/O modules (4). PROFIBUS Devices are imported into CODESYS by means of device description files (GSD). These files are supplied with the hardware. In CODESYS , it is possible to insert a USB interface in the device tree for PROFIBUS . This interface (PROFIusb by the company \"Softing\"), which is connected to the USB port of the computer, is used in the network as a PROFIBUS Master. It provides the full functionality of a PROFIBUS Master. (1) PROFIBUS(2) PROFIBUS(3) PROFIBUS(4) PROFIBUSFor more general information on fieldbus support in  CODESYS , see: Fieldbus support " },

Automatic bus initialization : At the time of download or reset, the bus is initialized automatically without any user prompt. : The user is prompted whether the bus should be reinitialized on download or reset. A reinitialization interrupts the bus and could lead to unexpected behavior of the machinery. For PROFIBUS NetX configurations, you can use the GetLiveList method to check which bus devices are available in the connected hardware. The method is included in the automatically integrated library IoDrvCifXProfibus . For a rising edge of the xEnable input, the method requires a current list of all devices connected to the PROFIBUS. The operation is complete when the wOpState output takes the value HIL_DONE or HIL_ERROR .

Addresses are checked for duplicates. Highest station address The highest station address (HSA) on the bus. To attain a stricter GAP range, you can indicate a lower address here. GAP range: Address range that is scanned for new active devices. Mode Auto Clear Mode : In case of an error, the master switches from Operate status to Clear status, and ends the communication to all assigned slaves as soon as a slave does not respond within the Data control time . The digital outputs are set to 0, and the analog outputs are set to the configured substitute values (FailSave). The master has to be reset in order to restart the communication. : In case of an error, the master remains in Operate status and the communication to all slaves continues. Automatic startup : The master starts by itself. : The master has to be started manually. Caution: Whether or not the setting is evaluated depends on the driver. Groups Opens the Groups dialog. See the description for the Groups dialog. Watchdog Watchdog function for netX firmware : The firmware stops operating if it is not updated by the driver within the specified period of time. This makes sure that the firmware does not continue to run in case the CODESYS application crashes with an exception or similar. This option is not a PROFIBUS option, but a netX-specific function. Parameter These parameters define the time behavior of communication on the PROFIBUS . Baud rate [kBits\/s]: The baud rates defined in the device description file (GSD file). However, you can set only the baud rate that is supported by all slaves. Use defaults : The values in the parameter table are reset to their defaults according to the set baud rate. : You can change the values in the parameter table.

T_SDR Minimum \"station delay responder time\" [Tbit]: Minimum response time that a device can respond on the bus (min. 11 Tbit) max. T_SDR Maximum \"station delay responder time\" [Tbit]: Maximum time span that a slave has to respond. T_QUI Idle period which must be taken into account during conversion of NRZ (Non Return to Zero) signals to other codings (switchover time for repeater) T_SET \"Setup time\" [Tbit]: Time for setup T_TR \"Target Time for Rotation\" [Tbit]; projected time interval when a master should receive the token. Result of the sum of the token stop times of all masters on the bus. Gap GAP update factor G: Number of bus cycles after which the masters GAP (address range from its own bus address to the address of the next active station) is searched for an additional, recently inserted active station. Retry limit Maximum number of repeated request attempts by the master when it has not received a valid response from the slave Slave Interval Time between two bus cycles when a slave can process a request from the master (time base: 100µs). The value here must agree with the specifications in the GSD files of the slave. Poll timeout Maximum time when the response from the master must be received by the requester in a master–master communication (DP_Master class 2) (time base: 1ms). Data control time Time [ms] when the master communicates its operating status with the assigned slaves. At the same time, the master monitors whether at least one payload exchange each has taken place with the slaves within this period, and updates the Data_Transfer_List.

"body" : "Generally, for each IEC task, the used input data is read at the start of each task (1) and the written output data is transferred to the I\/O driver at the end of the task (3). The implementation in the I\/O driver is decisive for additional transfer of the I\/O data. It is responsible for the time frame and time point that the actual transfer to the corresponding bus system occurs. The bus cycle task of the PLC can be defined globally for all fieldbuses in the PLC settings. For some fieldbuses, however, you can change this independent of the global setting. The task with the shortest cycle time is used as the bus cycle task (setting: unspecified in the PLC settings). The messages are normally sent on the bus in this task. Other tasks copy only the I\/O data from an internal buffer that is exchanged only with the physical hardware in the bus cycle task.

If an output is written in various tasks, then the status is undefined, as this can be overwritten in each case. If the same inputs are used in various tasks, then it is possible for the input to change during the processing of a task. This happens when the task is interrupted by a task with a higher priority and causes the process image to be read again. Solution: At the beginning of the IEC task, copy the input variables to variables and then work only with the local variables in the rest of the code. Conclusion: Using the same inputs and outputs in several tasks does not make any sense and can lead to unexpected reactions in some cases. " },

If a device description cannot be found, then the following message is shown: \"Attention! The device was not found in the repository.\" Depending on the bus system, additional information is displayed, such as vendor number and product number. The device cannot be inserted into the project without the installed device description. Show differences to project : The table in the dialog also shows additional configured devices (in the device tree of the project). : The table shows all scanned devices. The configured devices are not shown. Scan for Devices Starts a new search. Copy All Devices to Project The device which is selected in the table is inserted into the device tree in the project. If nothing is selected, then all scanned devices are shown. If you use Copy All Devices to Project to insert devices, which are available in the device tree, to the device tree, then the following should be noted: The data of the Process Data and <...> I\/O Mapping tabs of the existing devices may be overwritten with the data of the recently inserted devices. Configured Devices This part of the dialog is visible only when you select the Show differences to project option. Differences between the scanned and configured devices are color-coded. Devices displayed in green are identical on both sides. Devices displayed in red are available only in the view of the scanned or configured devices. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted above the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted below the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the configured devices are replaced by the selected scanned device. All scanned devices are copied to the project. Deletes the selected configured device. " },
