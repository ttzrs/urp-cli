"body" : "The CODESYS Control Extension Package provides many different options and interfaces to connect your own programs to the Linux runtime system and the IEC application. This allows you, for example, to control the PLC, respond to events from the PLC, or add your own functionality to the PLC or IEC application. See below for an overview of the most important interfaces and functionalities. Note: \"From outside the PLC\" still means that you are on the Linux system. The interfaces are available on the Linux system only and not on another device, but still outside of the runtime process. External Event Task: You can control the execution time for an IEC task yourself (from outside of the PLC). Event Mechanism: You can react outside of the PLC to events of the IEC application (example: Start\/Stop\/Exception). Access to the PLC Shell: You can access the PLC shell outside of the PLC. START\/STOP Switch: You can connect your own start\/stop switch (outside of the PLC) with very easy ways. Calling an External Function: You can very easily call your own functionality which is implemented outside of the PLC. Linking Your Own I\/Os: You can easily connect your own I\/Os (example: local) outside of the PLC. Extension SDK: You can very easily implement your own functions in C code, which can then be used from the IEC application. Retain Data in Shared Memory: You can connect retain data from the application via SHM in the controller. For an overview of the security measures taken, as well as security-relevant notices, see: Security Mechanisms. These new mechanisms and interfaces are largely based on process separation which are based on Linux standard resources (files, sockets, or similar). Among other things, \"unix domain sockets\" are used, and therefore a \"remote terminal\" can be implemented independent of technology (Python, C, an so on). Connecting your own C code (Extension SDK) is an exception because C code compiled here in the form of a dynamic runtime system component (shared object) is directly added to the CODESYS runtime system and executed. For more information, see: Extension SDK . The examples are located in the installation directory of the CODESYS Control Extension Package . By default, this is: C:\\Program Files\\CODESYS <version>\\CODESYS\\CODESYS Control SL Extension Package\\<version>\\Examples . " },

"body" : "The extension API provides comprehensive options to influence the runtime system. As a result, the user has to pay attention to necessary security measures. For CODESYS Control Extension Package 4.4.0.0 and higher, the codesysuser group is created when the package is installed. Some functions of the extension API require that the Linux user who uses them is a member of the codesysuser group. You can add a user to this group with administrator privileges the following command (as an example): $ sudo adduser $USER codesysuser The reason behind this procedure is that the mechanisms use the \/var\/run\/codesysextension\/ and \/var\/opt\/codesysextension\/ working directories. These have 770 permission and is assigned to the codesysuser group. This ensures that unauthorized users cannot interfere with the runtime system. All members of the codesysuser group can influence the runtime system. The following mechanisms are based on a Unix Domain Socket (UDS): External Event Task Event Mechanism Access to the PLC Shell Calling an External Function Linking Your Own I\/Os It is necessary for the IEC programmer to query error codes of the respective function block for these mechanisms and to react appropriately (example: establishing or aborting a connection). To prevent a workload attack, the Unix peers ( U nix D omain S ockets) need to have at least the same priority or a higher priority than the IEC task itself. The UDS peers are the provided examples or the user-created programs which use the functions of the Extension API. This priority is not the priority displayed in the task configuration of CODESYS . It can be determined on the Linux system by means of htop . This is a task which has the same name as the IEC task assigned in CODESYS . The PLC shell requires the \"anonymous user\". If this is enabled, then it is not possible to trace which Linux user has used the PLC shell. Due to the process separation, the new interfaces of the CODESYS Control Extension Package do not provide the capability of user authentication (from the point of view of the CODESYS Development System ). It is not possible to assign a corresponding Linux user or user name to an IEC user. As a result, not only the IEC users but also the Linux users have to be considered and administered accordingly when considering the security of the IEC application. Only authorized users may have administrative access to the Linux system of the runtime system. In the case of interfaces which use process separation, it cannot be ruled out that data is passed unencrypted on the system. This means that an attacker with administrative permissions on the system could record them. " },

To check your runtime version, click Extras → Update Linux → System → System info . Check whether or not the real-time kernel is really being used. As of version 4.11.0.0, you can use the PLC shell command rt-get kernelinfo to check this. If you have an older version, then you can do this directly on the command line with the command uname -a . If the real-time kernel is not being used, then you need to start again from the beginning. " },

Optimization options After changing each setting or combination of settings, you should run the \"cyclictest\" program to verify the effectiveness of the changes. You can use the Multicore feature in CODESYS . Determine the correct priorities for your tasks. Important tasks should have a higher priority. Mapping of IEC task priorities and Linux thread priorities: IEC Task Priority Linux Priority -- 88 (SCHED_FIFO) -- 57 (SCHED_FIFO) 0 (highest real-time priority) 56 (SCHED_FIFO) 15 (lowest real-time priority) 41 (SCHED_FIFO) 16 (not real-time priority) 0 (SCHED_OTHER) 31 (not real-time priority) 0 (SCHED_OTHER) -- 0 (SCHED_OTHER) On a conventional Linux system, most interrupts (IRQs) and kernel workers are at Linux priority 50. Using priorities (with high load) above that can lead to system functions (network\/storage) not working as desired. You can configure the priority of a task in the respective task configuration.

With the help of \"kernel trace\", you can see whether your task is being interrupted by another task, another service, or an interrupt. trace-cmd record -p function You can use KernelShark to examine the generated trace.dat file. In general, scheduling problems can be divided into two categories: Supersession \/ preemption If the interrupt or the task preventing execution is unnecessary, then disable it. Increase the priority of your task or reduce the priority of the others. Switch to a different CPU core. Check the effectiveness of the changes by using the programs described in the previous chapter. Execution time See below: \"Kernel function trace\" Kernel function trace If you determine that the code execution time is too high, then you can use this tool to pinpoint the problem. If the function with too high execution time is in your own code, then you need to optimize it. If the function with too high execution time is in the kernel, then you can try to achieve the desired functionality with another kernel function. Alternatively, you could also pass configuration parameters to the kernel driver in order to reduce the execution time. If none of these options solve the problem, then you will probably need to use more powerful hardware.

Authentication can be done by providing credentials (user name and password). You can also choose a more powerful method by using key-based authentication (public key authentication). The user uses a key to log on to the controller. A key consists of a public and a private key. This kind of key pair is much harder to compromise than a password. The logging operation checks whether the public key of the controller matches the private key of the development system. When this is the case, access is granted without using a password. You create the SSH keys used in CODESYS on the Windows-based development system. You can optionally specify a passphrase so that the security of public key authentication is increased even more.

PLCNext The Deploy Tool attempts to read the firmware version with the following command: cat \/etc\/plcnext\/arpversion | head -1 | cut -f2 -d' ' | cut -f-3 -d '.' If the version cannot be read, then the installation is aborted. The Deploy Tool searches locally for the codesys-arp PLCnext package in a version which matches the firmware. The package is installed. If no package is found or the installation fails, then the installation of the product is aborted. Raspberry Pi After the package is installed, the runtime type to be used is defined. The type depends on the loaders which are available on the system.

Proceed step by step and disable \"irrelevant\" filters to get a better view of the problem. Enable the Debug message category via the PLC shell (for runtime versions >= SP20). Open your CODESYS project and connect it to the controller. Open the PLC shell by double-clicking the controller in the device tree. Enter \"?\" in the shell in order to see all possible commands. Use the logsetfilter , loggetfilter , and logdelfilter commands to write, read, and delete a filter. You can either use global debug filters for the entire runtime or filters for a specific component. To read the current log category globally: loggetfilter could return the following output: Logger.0.Filter : 0x0000000F To set the current log category globally: logsetfilter 0xffffffff To read the current log category for a specific component (for example, CmpCodeMeter ): loggetfilter CmpCodeMeter To set the current log category for a specific component (for example, CmpCodeMeter): logsetfilter CmpCodeMeter 0xffffffff Enabling the logger category via the runtime configuration file (for older runtime versions) Example: Via an SSH connection and a text editor Stop the runtime via the Deploy Tool.

"body" : "The following effects can be caused by a file handle leak: Loss of license status. The WIBU license is broken after a certain period of time. New files cannot be opened. The default behavior of Linux processes is to allow a maximum number of open file handles. When a process reaches this limit, no more new files can be opened. You can check the limit value of your system with the console command: ulimit -n Every process in Linux has a process ID and the kernel provides detailed information about each process in its file\/folder system procfs . This allows you to easily determine the number of file handles which one process has at any given time. We recommend the following steps to investigate a possible file handle leak: Find the process ID of the CODESYS runtime environment. You can use standard Linux tools to find the process ID of the CODESYS runtime environment: htop normally displays the process ID in the first column (PID). top normally displays the process ID in the first column (PID). You can combine the ps and grep commands for a quick search: ps aux | grep codesyscontrol Take note of the process ID and use it in the following commands where the placeholder <pid> is used. Check and monitor the file handles. Now list the entries in procfs to see the file handles of the runtime process. sudo ls -la \/proc\/<pid>\/fd\/ This may look as follows If the file handles are \"real\" files, then you can see the path. Other file handles could be sockets or similar. If you execute this command multiple times one after the other, then you can observe whether you have an increasing number of file handles and which files are open. The watch command creates a view which is updated every 2 seconds. watch sudo ls -la \/proc\/<pid>\/fd\/ These actions can help you monitor the open handles and therefore find out which files could be involved in the file handle leak.

(See packet number 58 and following.) A typical problematic situation in which CODESYS Safe Control SL will issue an exception \/ problem due to timing can be seen in packet number 74: This packet is received ~2 ms after the previous packet, so the delay is ~1 ms. This is not acceptable for CODESYS Safe Control SL as a reliable and real-time-capable timestamp. Actions to reduce the delay Find out whether the problem is visible on the receiving or sending side. You must consider both the receiving side ( CODESYS Safe Control Host) and the sending side ( CODESYS Safe Time Provider Host). Improve the real-time capabilities and robustness of this timestamp communication in general. You can do this by removing other interfering communication and load from this network (use exclusively for safe timestamps). Improve the sending and receiving performance by configuring the process priority of the corresponding IRQ (of the network driver). If you cannot improve any further and if your safety process allows it, you can increase the cycle time of the CODESYS Safe Time Provider (sending the timestamp). " },

"body" : "The executable file Setup_CODESYSControlRTE<32|64>V3.<version>setup.exe in the installation package is mentioned in the following \"setup\". The setup installs all available drivers that are included in the package. The setup determines the type of platform to be installed on and modifies the configuration file CODESYSControl.cfg automatically (after you confirm). By default, the working directory of CODESYS Control RTE is C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS\\CODESYSControlRTEV3 . Requirements: You know the number of CPU cores in the system where you want to install the CODESYS Control RTE . You have performed the preparations described above on your system. (The exact designation of your CPU is shown in the \"System\" dialog of the Windows control panel. With that information, you can use the Internet to research the number of physical CPU cores.) Please also note the information about hardware configuration: Hardware Configuration – RecommendationsLoad the installation package to your computer. CODESYS Control RTE is available in the CODESYS Store International as a single-license version. Start the installation by executing the file CODESYS Control RTE <32|64> <version>.exe . Follow the wizard with the default settings until the MultiCore CPU Usage dialog is displayed. Result: The installation wizard tries to detect the total number of physical processor cores in Cores Total . Check this information and correct it if necessary. In Cores RTE , define how many processor cores should be reserved exclusively for the CODESYS Control RTE tasks. As a result, these cores are no longer available for Windows (\"AMP\" mode). Note: The number which was already specified (example: 6 ) is merely a suggestion of the setup. Normally the setup can correctly detect the number of physical CPU cores of your system. A CPU core that is displayed by Windows can also be a \"logical\" CPU core that is not appropriate for operating the real-time system on it (\"hyperthreading core\"). Also follow the instruction: Hyperthreading MUST be disabled by BIOS settings! . CPU features such as hyperthreading negatively influence the real-time behavior. You will have to confirm later in a dialog that the setup should reserve a CPU core for the RTE by changing the boot configuration of the system. When doing this, the boot option numproc is set to <number of physical processors minus 1 >. Click Next to confirm the specified number of cores. You then see the Boot Options will Change dialog with information about the noted changes to the boot configuration of the PC. Click Next to continue to the Set Boot Options? dialog. Result: In the Set Boot Options dialog, you decide whether or not the setup should apply the following changes to the start configuration of the system: Limit of the number of CPU cores that are available to Windows; by means of the boot option \" numproc \" to <number of physical cores> - 1 . Deactivation of the processor functionality \"Data Execution Prevention\". Deactivation of the processor functionality \"Physical Address Extension (PAE)\". The processor functionalities \"Data Execution Prevention\" and \"PAE\" do not have to be deactivated necessarily. By editing the start configuration manually, you can limit only the number of cores for Windows. However, this kind of configuration is not tested by CODESYS . The boot option numproc is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the RTE in this configuration. Therefore, if you decide here that the setup should not set this option, then you need to activate the option manually. If the setup should apply the changes just described, then click Yes . If you want perform these changes manually at a later time, then click No . Click Next to continue to the Target Type of RTE dialog. Result: With version CODESYS 3.5 SP17, a distinction between the device types \"Control\" and \"SoftMotion\" is no longer necessary. The device type \"Control\" also includes the full functionality that was reserved previously for SoftMotion devices. The distinction now only exists for compatibility reasons. For new projects, we recommend using \"Control\". In the Target Type of RTE dialog, select the RTE type to be installed: CODESYS Control RTE or CODESYS SoftMotion RTE . The type of installation depends on your application and license. Select \"SoftMotion\" only if you have purchased and want to use a CODESYS SoftMotion RTE license. If not, then the RTE will start in time-limited demo mode. In the next Select Features dialog, you can still change the selection of the actual functionalities to install: CODESYS SoftMotion RTE and CodeMeter ® for Windows . You can switch manually between both CODESYS Control RTE types at a later time by editing the configuration file CODESYSControl.cfg . Do this by entering the following lines in the configuration file CODESYSControl.cfg : [SysTarget] TargetType=0x1006 DeviceName=CODESYS SoftmotionRTE V3 By deleting these entries (or prepending with a semicolon), you get a CODESYS Control RTE again. In the Select Features dialog, select the functionalities you want to install. Open the firewall if you want to access the CODESYS Control RTE from other computers. This is necessary, for example, for communication with CODESYS , CODESYS OPC, and when working with Ethernet-based fieldbuses. Result: In one of the execution steps, you are prompted whether the time accuracy of CODESYS Control RTE should be increased by creating and activating a hardware profile. If you affirm this, then the power option \"High Performance\" (Control Panel -> Power Options) is selected and the CPU rate is set to 100%. After the installation is ended successfully, the symbol is displayed in the status bar of the screen. You can open the CODESYS Control RTE menu by right-clicking it. The configuration file CODESYSControl.cfg is adapted automatically. Check whether or not the current device description for CODESYS Control RTE installed in your CODESYS Development System . This installation is needed for using CODESYS Control RTE with CODESYS . (The development system is not necessarily located on the target system where the RTE is running.) If you need to reinstall the device description, for example because a subsequent change was necessary, then open the CODESYS device repository and execute the Install command. The description files for adapting the RTE ( .devdesc.xml ) are generated by the setup in the installation directory Others . It is imperative that you execute the restart that is required at the end of the installation. For more information, see: Installing Devices " },

For this, you simply have to enter the component \"CmpHilscherCIFX\" in the configuration file of CODESYS Control Win as follows: [ComponentManager]\nComponent.<n>=CmpHilscherCIFX Then after installing the adapter, you just have to install the driver SysDrv3S.sys when starting the operating system. This is located in the CODESYS installation directory in $\\GatewayPLC\\Driver for a 32-bit Windows operating system, or in $\\GatewayPLC\\Driver\\x64 for a 64-bit Windows operating system. Note: The Hilscher configurator SyCon or SYCON.net and the Hilscher driver must not run parallel to CODESYS . Driver: CmpSoftingProfibus This component is necessary if you want to use a PROFIBUS master USB interface adapter from Softing Industrial Automation GmbH with CODESYS in an IEC application. It represents the interface between the runtime system and the proprietary driver from Softing, which is used by our driver library IoDrvSoftingPROFIusb . In CODESYS , this library is integrated automatically in the Library Manager when you add a device PROFIusb in the device tree. As a result, you can use and configure the CODESYS runtime system on a Windows PC as a PROFIBUS Master. For more information, see the following: Adding USB Interfaces for PROFIBUS Driver: CmpBACnet The component is needed when you want to use the BACnet IP link of CODESYS Control Win . The following entry is necessary in the configuration file: [ComponentManager]\nComponent.<n>=CmpBACnet Driver: CmpPCANBasicDrv This component implements the link of Peak CAN hardware by means of the PCAN basic API. For installation instructions, see the online help. No configuration file entries are necessary. Driver: CmpCAACanL2 This component provides a hardware-independent interface for sending and receiving CAN messages. Optional configuration file entries: [CmpCAACanL2]\n;If setting PersistentBaudrate is enabled (0: disabled; 1: enabled)\n;the baudrate will be stored into Net.X.DefaultBaudrate (where X equals NetId) when opening the driver.\nPersistentBaudrate=1\n;Default baudrate for CAN network 0. This baudrate will be used when the network is opened (e.g from CmpBlkDrvCan or CANopen) with the baudrate set to 0.\nNet.0.DefaultBaudrate=1000 In the configuration file, a standard baud rate can be saved for each CAN network (physical CAN connection). This standard baud rate is always used when the CL2 function DriverOpenH is called with baud rate 0 and the driver is not open yet. If this configuration file entry is missing, then an error is issued in the cited case because the baud rate is unknown. The entry is particularly useful in connection with the function PersistenBaudrate which is deactivated by default. If PersistentBaudrate=1 , then CODESYS uses the function CmpSettings to write this baud rate in the configuration file at a specific baud rate for each call of DriverOpenH . This has the effect, for example, that the entry Net.0.DefaultBaudrate is changed. This is especially useful when a controller communicates via the CAN block driver. If the baud rate is 0 ( 0.Baud rate = 0 ) in CmpBlkDrvCanServer , then the user can change the baud rate of the block driver communication by means of changing the baud rate in the project, downloading the application, and restarting the controller. Driver: CmpCAASdoClient This component implements the CANopen SDO client protocol. Optional configuration entries: [CmpCAASdoClient]\nMaxSegmentsPerCycle=0 ; for block download: maximum of sent segments per cycle; 0 means infinity You can reduce the number of CAN messages that are sent per cycle in a block transfer here. This is necessary when a controller has problems with a series of many CAN frames at the same ID. However, this also limits the performance, causing a block transfer to take more time. Driver: CmpCAASDOServer This component implements the CANopen SDO server protocol. Optional configuration file entries: [CmpCAASdoClient]\nMaxSegmentsPerCycle=0 ; for block download: maximum of sent segments per cycle; 0 means infinity The number of CAN messages that are sent per cycle in a block transfer can be reduced here. Driver: CmpEL6751CanDrv This component implements the link of the Beckhoff EL6751 CAN\/EtherCAT gateway terminal. As the component implements a CAN Minidriver, you can use the CANL2 component and all CODESYS CAN-based stacks. No configuration file entries are required. Driver: CmpNetXCanDlDrv This component is a CAN Minidriver for a NetX CAN adapter. With this driver, CODESYS Control Win can use the CAN libraries from CODESYS GmbH via a NetX adapter. The configuration of the component in the configuration file of CODESYS Control Win : [CmpNetXCanDlDrv]\nMaxNumberOfCanNetworks=0..n -> number of the CAN networks (number of the NetIds)\nNetId.0.Channel=0 -> mapping of the NetId onboard nad NetX channels (see CmpHilscherCIFX)\nNetId.0.Board=0\n\n[ComponentManager]\n...\nComponent.6=CmpHilscherCIFX\nComponent.7=CmpNetXCanDlDrv\n...

The CmpDrvSchedulerAPIC can still be used on this platform only. With this component, the CODESYS Control RTE can use time slicing to share CPU core 0 with Windows. When the CODESYS Control RTE is started for the first time, complicated measurements are performed in order to scale the clock speeds to microseconds. The results of this measurement are saved in the Windows Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CmpDrvSchedulerAMP\\Params or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CmpDrvSchedulerAPIC\\Params ; values SetClocksPerUS and SetCountsPerMS . For each subsequent start of the CODESYS Control RTE , the measurements are not performed again if the values obtained from the measurement at the first startup can be read from the Registry.

"body" : "You may need to modify the BIOS settings in order for the CODESYS Control RTE to run on the respective platform with optimally low jitter. See the following examples for modifications which should be considered only as recommendations. The following BIOS settings should always be disabled: HT (hyperthreading with Intel CPUs; simultaneous multithreading with AMD CPUs) VT (virtualization technology for Intel CPUs; AMD-V for AMD CPUs) In Windows 10 or higher, VT causes Windows itself to be started in a virtual environment and the RTE is therefore unable to start a CPU core even though it is not used by Windows. An alternative to disabling this BIOS option is therefore to disable the Windows \"Virtual Machine Platform\" feature or the \"Windows Hypervisor Platform\" feature. In the end, disabling the VT option is the BIOS is the better option. Legacy USB or other BIOS functions which lead to periodic SMIs. SMIs are system management interrupts which stop the entire system for a few tens or hundreds of microseconds. Energy-saving options for Intel or AMD processors which lead to frequency changes (such as EIST for Intel CPUs, or Cool'n'Quiet for AMD CPUs) Periodic self-tests or memory tests The \"sleep modes\" play a decisive role (\"C-States\" in ACPI terminology). Higher numbers after the \"C\" indicate lower sleep states. In sleep mode, the processors not only scale down the voltage and clock speed, but they also deactivate the cache and entire areas in the service. In the BIOS, the options responsible for this are typically called \"C-States\". \"SpeedStep\" from Intel or \"PowerNow\" from AMD are sometimes referred to as \"EIST\", and they have to be disabled in this case. In the case that the check or configuration of the processor settings is not completed by the BIOS, or the option is not available, then you can find the corresponding tools on the Internet. Examples: RightMark CPU CPU-Z (CPUID) RM Clock Power options such as Fast Startup or Hibernate must not be allowed under any circumstances. " },

Driver: CmpNetXCanDlDrv This component is a CAN minidriver for a NetX CAN adapter. With this driver, CODESYS Control RTE can use the CAN libraries from CODESYS GmbH via a NetX adapter. CmpNetXCanDlDrv can only be used with CmpHilscherCIFX over which you have to load a CAN firmware (master or slave). It does not matter whether a master or slave is used because CmpNetXCanDlDrv uses only the CAN driver interface of the adapter. The protocol is managed by a 3S CAN library.

This is possible by an editor or by means of the PLC Configuration dialog. Generate the [CmpHilscherCIFX] section as well. The following entries are necessary for the driver (example): Device.0.BootloaderFilePath=NXCIF50-RTE.bin\nDevice.0.Channel.0.FirmwareFile=cifxdpm.nxf In this example, the 0 in Device.0 is the 0-based index of the adapter if more than one is used. Channel is always followed by 0 because all PCI adapters from Hilscher support only one channel. The files that contain the boot loaders or firmware are delivered with the CifX card from Hilscher. You have to place them in the root file directory of the CODESYS Control RTE . You may also have to adapt the file names or entries in the configuration file.

"body" : "Driver: CmpCX5000Mpd This is a Windows network driver. It can be used only on a CXxxxx Beckhoff PC with a CX5000 communication processor. If the setup of CODESYS Control RTE is executed on a CXxxxx PC, then the driver CmpCX5000Mpd is installed automatically and added to a list of components (in the cfg file). Additional information and manual installation: Exception: A CX-IPC was installed by default with \"Windows7 embedded standard\". This comprises a Beckhoff driver for the PCI device with the hardware IDs VendorID = SubVendorID = 0x15ec and DeviceID = SubDeviceID = 0x5000 . After the installation of CODESYS Control RTE , you can replace this driver with the driver CmpCX5000Mpd.sys . In this case, use the function Update driver software in the Windows Control Panel: Open the Windows Device Manager. Search for the system device from Beckhoff, right-click it, and then execute the command Update driver software . In the wizard, select the Search for driver software manually option and click Have disk . Select the inf file in the installation directory of CODESYS Control RTE (subdirectory CmpCX5000Mpd ). Confirm any prompts as to whether the driver should be installed. Windows installs a network adapter named CX5000 driver for CODESYS Ethernet . Manually specify the driver in the configuration file CoDeSysControl.cfg (installation directory of CODESYS Control RTE ): Example: Component.3=CmpCX5000Mpd . Then a download of a CODESYS project with EtherCAT should no longer display unresolved references. Driver: CmpCXSecUPS This driver can be used only on an \"embedded PC\" in the CX5000 or CX5100 series from Beckhoff. The component monitors a pin that monitors the state of the power supply in low-priority, cyclic call of the communication task. If a power failure is detected, then the applications are stopped and the retain data saved in a file (typically Application.ret ). Note: The following restrictions exist when saving retain data: Depending on the current load of the PLC, the detection of the power failure may be delayed. Depending on the load of the PC, the time varies that can be used for saving data after a power failure. Due to these restrictions, you have to test the storage of the retain data with the completed applications. Moreover, it is recommend that the validity of the remanent variables is checked at the application start. The component does not have any configuration options. You have to add them only to the component list of the controller. For more information, see: Registry Entries of the RTE " },
