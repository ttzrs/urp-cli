"body" : "Checking the terminal resistance The terminal resistance is used to adapt the impedance of a node to the impedance of the used transmission cable. When there is a mismatch of the impedance, the transmitted signal is not completely absorbed by the load and part of it is reflected back into the transmission cable. If the impedances of source, transmission cable, and load are the same, then these reflections are eliminated. In this test, the serial resistance of the CAN data pair cables and the connected terminal resistors are measured. Switch off the power supply of all CAN nodes. Measure the resistance between CAN_H and CAN_L in the middle and at the end of the network. The measured value should be between 50 Ω and 70 Ω. The value should be the same at all locations in the network. If the value is less than 50 Ω, then make sure of the following: There is no short circuit between the CAN_H and CAN_L cables. No more than two terminal resistors exist. The nodes do not have defective transceivers. If the value is greater than 70 Ω, then make sure of the following: No open circuit exists in the wiring of the CAN_H and CAN_L cables. The bus system has two terminal resistors, each 120 Ω – one at each end. Voltage of CAN_H\/CAN_L Every node contains a CAN transceiver which sends difference signals. When the network communication is idle, the voltages CAN_H and CAN_L are approximately 2.5 V. Faulty transceivers can cause the open-circuit voltages to vary and disrupt network communication. Switch off the power supply of all CAN nodes. Stop all network communication. Measure the direct current between CAN_H and GND. The measured value should be between 2.0 V and 4.0 V. If it is less than 2.0 V or greater than 4.0 V, then it is possible that one or more nodes have a faulty transceiver. At a voltage less than 2.0 V, you need to check the CAN_H and CAN_L cables for continuity. At a voltage greater than 4.0 V, you need to check for overvoltage. Ground The shielding of the CAN network may be grounded at only one location. This test indicates whether or not the shielding is grounded at multiple locations. Separate the shield from the ground. Measure the direct current resistance between the shield and the ground. Connect the shield to the ground. The resistance should be greater than 1 MΩ. If it is lower, then you need to search for an additional grounding of the shield. CAN transceiver resistance check CAN transceivers have a circuit which controls CAN_H and another circuit that controls CAN_L. Experience has shown that electrical damage to one or both circuits can increase the leakage current in these circuits. Use a resistance measuring instrument to measure the leakage current. Separate the node from the network. Leave the node without any current. Measure the direct current resistance between CAN_H and CAN_GND. Measure the direct current resistance between CAN_L and CAN_GND. Normally the resistance should be between 1 MΩ and 4 MΩ or higher. If it is lower than this range, then the CAN transceiver is probably defective. " },

Error handling aims at detecting errors in CAN messages so that the sender can resend a failed message. Every CAN controller tries to detect errors within a message. When an error is found, the detecting node sends an error flag and therefore disrupts the bus traffic. The other nodes will detect the error which was caused by the error flag (if they have not already detected the original error). They will take appropriate action and reject the current message.

Select a CAN minidriver device description. Do not select the original device description from Beckhoff. Instead, a CAN minidriver device description is required. This device description is provided with the EtherCAT package. The number of messages indicates the maximum number of CAN messages which can be received or sent per cycle (this means how many messages are tunneled via the EtherCAT per frame). Insert the scanned devices. Now you can insert a CAN-based stack below the CANbus node, such as CANopenManager, CANopenDevice, or J1939Manager. Then you can use them as usual. In the CANbus node, you can only change the baud rate. The network ID is assigned automatically at runtime.\nAlternatively, you could also address the CAN via CL2 or CAN-API. You can get the network ID for opening the driver by means of the corresponding function block. You should set the EtherCAT bus task so that it is fast enough. For example, if you want to send or receive CAN messages in a 4ms interval, you should set the bus cycle task to at least 4ms (or faster is even better) to be able to maintain the send interval.

Autostart CANopen Manager : The CANopen Manager starts automatically (switches to OPERATIONAL mode) after all required slaves are ready. : The CANopen Manager has to be started from the application. The CiA405.NMT function block can be used to do this. Hint: As long as the CANopen Manager is not in OPERATIONAL mode, no PDOs are sent (outputs refreshed). Polling of optional slaves : When a slave does not respond during the boot sequence, the CANopen Manager interrogates it every second until it does respond. Constantly polling the slave increases the bus cycle time, which can interfere with the application (especially motion applications). You can deactivate polling to avoid this behavior. If polling is deactivated, then a slave is detected again when it sends a bootup message. Start slaves : The CANopen Manager is responsible for starting the slaves. : You have to start the slaves from the application. Use the CiA405 NMT function block to do this. NMT start all (if possible) : If the Start slaves option is activated, then the CANopen Manager starts all slaves with an \"NMT Start All\" command. The \"NMT Start All\" command is not executed as long as optional slaves are not yet ready to be started. In this case, the CANopen Manager starts each slave individually. The \"NMT Start All\" command can be guaranteed only in a project without optional slaves. NMT error behavior Restart slave . If an error occurs during slave monitoring (NMT Error Event), then the slave is restarted automatically by the stack (NMT Reset + SDO Configuration + NMT Start). Stop slave . If an error occurs during slave monitoring (NMT Error Event), then the slave is stopped. Then you have to reset the slave from the application, using the CiA405 NMT function block. Guarding Working with heartbeat messages is an alternative method of monitoring. It can be executed from both master and slave nodes, as opposed to node guarding. Normally the master sends heartbeat messages to the slaves. Enable heartbeat producing The master sends heartbeats. They define the time interval in the Producer time . When the slaves are provided with the heartbeat function, a heartbeat consuming entry from the slave is created for the master. Then the Node-ID and the 1.5x heartbeat interval of the master are applied. : Node guarding is enabled for the slaves. The settings from the EDS file of the slaves are used for this. If the values there cannot be used, then default values are used. Note that a CANopen Slave device can also be configured as a heartbeat producer. Node-ID Unique identification (1-127) of the heartbeat producer on the bus Producer time (ms) Interval length between successive heartbeats (in milliseconds) Redundancy Node-ID Requirement: A Redundancy Configuration object is inserted below the application. Unique identification (1-127) of the redundant heartbeat producer on the bus Redundancy wait time (µs) Requirement: A Redundancy Configuration object is inserted below the application. Duration of how long the passive controller waits for the heartbeat of the active controller. If this time is exceeded, then the passive controller takes on the active role.

If the automatically generated mapping does not match your application, then you can deactivate the option and configure the mapping manually. We recommend that this option is activated for standard applications. Node Guarding Node guarding is an outdated monitoring method and should not be used anymore because is uses RTR frames. You should always use heartbeats whenever possible. In some exceptions, such as for older slaves, you can use only node guarding. Enable node guarding : The CANopen Manager sends a message to the slave in the Guard time (ms) interval. If the slave does not respond with the given Guard COB-ID (Communication Object Identifier), then the CANopen Manager resends this message as many times as defined in Lifetime factor or until the slave responds. If the slave does not respond, then it is marked as \"unavailable\".

Then the slave monitors the heartbeats that are sent from the affected slaves (defined by the Node-ID). When no more heartbeats are received, the slave switches off the I\/Os. When a slave is monitoring, a green check mark is displayed on the Heartbeat Consuming button. Note : When you insert a device with the heartbeat function, its heartbeat settings are harmonized automatically with the master (CANopen Manager).

"body" : "CANopen Safety is released as a European standard (EN 50325-5). This means that data can be transmitted via CAN networks which meet the requirements for SIL3 applications. This safety-oriented data transmission can occur parallel to an existing CANopen data transmission. CODESYS CANopen Safety supports the safety demands according to SIL2. In addition to the conventional CANopen services for data transmission such as SDO and PDO, a special service for this data transmission is defined for the safety extension with the SRDO service (safety related data object). Regarding configuration and type of communication, it is similar to a PDO, but additional properties are defined. To use CANopen Safety, the CANopen Manager SIL2 is inserted in the device tree instead of the CANopen Manager. Both safe devices (yellow device icon) and unsafe devices (gray device icon) can be inserted below this manager. As a result, unsafe and safe CAN subscribers can be operated in parallel. The safe subscribers have safety-specific pages in addition to the usual configuration pages. The SRDOs (safe PDOs) as well as their CRCs can be configured in these. Besides the usual unsafe device instances, an additional instance with prefix \"S_\" is generated for each safety device (CANopen Manager and Slaves). This provides safety-specific diagnostic capabilities. The use of the CANopen Manager SIL2 requires a SIL2 CODESYS Runtime with a specially adapted CAN mini-driver and a CODESYS SIL2 plug-in. The required libraries and devices are already included in the standard installation. " },

Possible causes: You do not have a license or the demo license has expired. Too little memory is available. The CANopen Manager has an orange triangle. The CANopen Manager is in the PREOPERATIONAL state. Possible causes: Not all mandatory slaves are in the OPERATIONAL state. Mark the unavailable devices in the Device Configurator as optional. The \"Autostart CANopen Manager\" option is not selected in the CANopen Manager configurator. You have to manually start the CANopen Manager in the application by means of the function block CiA405.NMT . A slave has an orange triangle. The slave is not in the OPERATIONAL state. The I\/O communication has not started yet. You can view the current state on the status page. You can manually start the slave in the application by means of the function block CiA405.NMT . A slave has a red exclamation mark. The slave has reported an emergency (for example, due to a broken cable) or configuration errors have occurred (SDO abort in the configuration phase). Check the status page and logger page of the CANopen Manager. You will find more information here. For more information about the emergency, see the manual for the slave. Possible causes of configuration errors: The EDS file does not match the device or it contains errors. Contact the manufacturer. For modular devices: The order or the type of the modules in the device tree do not match the physical construct. Perform a device scan on the CANopen Manager device and compare the configuration. A slave has a gray exclamation mark. An error occurred in the past which has been corrected in the meantime. You can check the logger page for which error this was. You can confirm the gray exclamation mark by clicking the Confirm button on the status page or the command in the context menu of the device. The inputs and outputs of the slave do not work. Possible causes: The CANopen Manager might not be in the OPERATIONAL state yet (no green icon). The CANopen Manager may edit PDOs only in the OPERATIONAL state. The CANopen Manager reaches this state only when all required CANopen subscribers are in the OPERATIONAL state. Moreover, the Autostart CANopen Manager option has to be set in the CANopen Manager configurator or the CANopen Manager has to be started manually by means of the function block CiA405.NMT. The affected slave is not in the OPERATIONAL state yet (no green icon) or configuration errors have occurred (SDO abort during configuration phase). You can read possible configuration errors in the logger of the respective slave and on the status page. If the Start Slaves option in the CANopen Manager configurator is deactivated, then you have to start the slaves manually by means of the function block CiA405.NMT so that the I\/O data traffic is included. If the Autostart CANopen Manager option is deactivated, then you also have to start the manager manually. The analog inputs of a slave do not work. Possible causes: For the input, no interrupt is generated in the slave. This can happen, for example, in the case of analog inputs when the associated PDO is set to transmission type \"asynchronous\" (254 or 255) and not Event time has been defined. Three solutions are provided for this purpose. Set the PDO to synchronous and activate Sync Producing in the CANopen Manager. Set the Event time of the PDO to values > 0 On the SDO page, insert the object 16#6423sub0 (analog input global interrupt enable) and set the value to 1 A slave quits sporadically (turns red and then green again). Possible causes: There are cycle time outliers in the bus cycle task. In the task monitor, check the minimum and maximum time of the bus cycle task. In the application, search for application code which produces these cycle time outliers: Optimize the code or move it to another task. A handle leak was caused by a faulty driver or incorrect usage of the CL2 layer. A physical error exists. See troubleshooting for CAN-based fieldbuses. " },

"body" : "CANopen Safety is released as a European standard (EN 50325-5). This means that data can be transmitted via CAN networks which meet the requirements for SIL3 applications. This safety-oriented data transmission can occur parallel to an existing CANopen data transmission. CODESYS CANopen Safety supports the safety demands according to SIL2. In addition to the conventional CANopen services for data transmission such as SDO and PDO, a special service for this data transmission is defined for the safety extension with the SRDO service (safety related data object). Regarding configuration and type of communication, it is similar to a PDO, but additional properties are defined. To use CANopen Safety, the CANopen Device SIL2 is inserted in the device tree instead of the CANopen Device. A safe CANopen Device has safety-specific pages in addition to the usual configuration pages. The SRDOs (safe PDOs) can be configured in these. Besides the usual unsafe device instances, an additional instance with prefix \"S_\" is generated for each safety device (CANopen Device). This provides safety-specific diagnostic capabilities.

If more than one ECU with the same address exists in the network, then all affected ECUs get a new address. The requirement is that the ECUs allow an address change ( Arbitrary Address Capable ). Local Device : You can configure any number of local ECUs. Then every local ECU is its own ECU instance in the J1939 network. For local devices, an additional RX Signals (P2P) dialog is provided to configure received signals. ECU NAME NAME (64 bit): 16# Hexadecimal 64-bit code which contains complete information about the subsequent parameters. Each time this code is modified, the respective parameter is also modified. The same is true for the other direction. Arbitrary address capable : When the ECU detects an address conflict, it tries independently to set another address. Industry group List of industry groups according to the definition from SAE J1939. Vehicle system instance The parameter depends on the Vehicle system . The 4-bit value assigns a number to each instance of the Vehicle system . Vehicle system The value is defined in the SAE J1939 standard. Reserved Always deactivated and reserved for future SAE definitions Function The parameter is defined and assigned by SAE. The value range is 0–255, but not all values are assigned. The interpretation of values, which are greater than or equal to 127, depends on the Industry selection. For example, the value \"133\" means \"Product Flow\" in the \"Agricultural and Forestry Equipment\" industry. If \"Construction Equipment\" is selected for Industry , then the same value means \"Land Leveling System Display\". If the value is less than 128 (0–127), then there is no dependency to other parameters. Function instance The parameter is related to the Function field. A J1939 network can consist of multiple ECUs with the same Function . The 5-bit Function instance assigns a number to each instance of the Function , where 0 is assigned to the first instance. ECU instance A J1939 network can include multiple ECUs that have the same task. For example, a vehicle can have two identical ECUs, where one measures vehicle speed and the other measures the trailer speed. Manufacturer code The 11-bit manufacturer code is assigned by SAE and indicates the company that manufactured the ECU. This code is defined in the SAE J1939 document. Identity number The 21-bit identity number is assigned by the manufacturer and should be used for assuring unique names in a product line. The manufacturer can also add more information to the identity number, such as serial number and date of manufacture. Communication Watchdog Enable communication watchdog : The stack checks whether the ECU transmits data within the specified Watchdog time . If this does not happen, then the device is classified as \"not available\" and highlighted in red in the device tree. " },
