"body" : "For more information about certificates and security, see CODESYS : CODESYS Security . Requirement: A digital signature for certificate exchange is configured. We assume that there is still no certificate on the controller which is intended for encrypted communication. In the following steps, you will generate this kind of certificate and encrypt communication: Configure the active path to the controller. To open the Security Screen view, double-click the symbol in the status bar or click View → Security-Screen . Select the Devices tab. Click the button to refresh the list of available devices and their certificate stores. On the left side, select the corresponding device. On the right side, there is still no license listed for the Encrypted communication use case. On the right side, select Encrypted Communication and click the button to create a new certificate on the device. In the Certificate Settings dialog, click OK to confirm the default settings for Key length and Validity period . The certificate is generated and listed in the table with its properties. The symbol before Encrypted communication is now displayed like this: . The field in the \"Valid until\" column is highlighted in green because the remaining time is still at least two-thirds of the entire validity period. In this step, you activate encrypted communication with the controller: Open the Security Screen view of CODESYS ( Users tab). In the Security Level group, select the Enforce encrypted communication option. As of this point, communication with all controllers is possible only as long as the certificate is valid on the controller and you have a key for it. The connecting line between the development system, the gateway, and the controller is displayed in yellow on the Communication Settings tab in the device editor of the controller. As an alternative to the Enforce encrypted communication option which was just described and which applies to all controllers, you can also encrypt communication with a specific controller only. To do this, open the Communication tab in the device editor of the controller. Click Encrypted Communication in the Device list box. Now log back in to the controller. A dialog opens with the notification that the certificate of the controller is not signed by a trusted source. In addition, the dialog displays information about the certificate and prompts for you to install it as a trusted certificate in the local store in the \"Controller Certificates\" folder. Confirm the dialog. The certificate is installed in the local store and you are logged in to the controller. In the future, communication with the controller will be encrypted automatically with this controller certificate. Note: When logging in to the controller, the expiration date of the certificate currently in use is checked. You get a warning if the remaining time is just one-third of the entire time or less. Then you can renew the certificate in time in the security screen. " },

For more information, see: Encrypted Communication with Devices via Controller CertificatesEncryption of the Boot Application, Download, and Online ChangeThe Devices tab shows all PLC devices configured in the project and their certificate store. If the communication path to the controller is configured, then you see the certificates that are stored in memory. Here you can create and configure new certificates on the controller. If a certificate currently in use is about to expire, then you get a warning when you log in to the device, and from there you can also switch directly to the Security Screen to renew the certificate. Left side: Information Devices and certificate store Shows the individual devices as expandable nodes, each with the controller-specific certificate store below it. For example, there are the following categories for CODESYS Control Win : Own certificates with the assigned private key to which you have access Trusted certificates created by a trusted certificate source Untrusted certificates that you defined specifically as not trusted Certificates in quarantine that do not fulfill the criteria of the categories above Toolbar (left side) : Refresh the display : Select certificate and transfer from the PC to the PLC (download). The default dialog for selecting a file from the local file system opens. File type: *.cer , *.crt , *.der . The certificate is stored on the PLC in the Untrusted Certificates memory. Ab CODESYS Control Version 3.5.18.0 also possible for the Own Certificates category: Import of a PKCS#12 container file (certificate + key), file type: *.p12 , *.pfx . After you select the container file from the file system, the Import Certificate Container dialog opens where you need to specify the password which was assigned when the file was created. By default, this container cannot be exported from the PLC again afterwards. If you want to allow this, enable the The container may be re-exported from the device option. Right side: Information If the active path to the controller is set and a device node is selected, then every use case for controller certificates is displayed on the right side. OPC UA Server : Encrypted communication over an OPC UA Server Encrypted Communication : Encrypted communication between the development system and the controller Encrypted Communication : Encryption of the boot application Web server : Encrypted communication with the web server As long as a certificate is not available for one of these use cases, it is displayed with the icon as (not available) . When a certificate store is selected on the left side, all certificates in it are displayed on the right side with the following information: Information : Use case; currently the controller component in question is displayed (example: CmpSecureChannel ) Created for : Name of the computer for which the certificate was created (example: MyLocalPC ) Created by : Name of the computer on which the certificate was created (example: MyLocalPC ) Valid as of : Date (example: 07\/20\/2017 15:09:29 ) Valid until : Date (example: 07\/20\/2022 00:00:00 . Depending on the remaining time of the certificate, the highlight color of the field changes: green -> yellow (two-thirds expired) -> orange (nine-tenths expired) -> red (expired). Note: When logging in to the controller, you get a warning when two-thirds or more of the validity period have expired. Then you can renew the certificate here in the Security Screen . Thumbprint : Hash value from specific properties of the certificate for purposes of identification (example: 279e1a46b86bd636c8e6f19fd51c222469ec49a8 ) Double-clicking a certificate entry opens the default Windows Certificate dialog. As a result, you can import a controller certificate into the Windows Certificate Store in the Controller Certificates folder, so that it is available for the encryption of boot applications, downloads, and online changes. If multiple certificates are available for one use case, then the system follows the steps below to determine the certificate that is used: Certificate which was created directly by the user (currently not supported) Filtering of existing certificates by: Subject (user of the certificate) Key usage Extended key usage Valid timestamp Dividing of detected, valid certificates as \"signed\" and \"self-signed\" Filtering of signed certificates, and the self-signed certificates by the following criteria: Longest validity period Strongest key Drag&Drop: Moving of the certificate to another certificate store of the same device Double-clicking a certificate entry opens the default Windows dialog for displaying all certificate information. Toolbar (right side) : Creates a new certificate for a specific use case: The Certificate Settings dialog opens for configuring the Validity period of the certificate and the Key length for the private key. Clicking OK saves the specified values in the CODESYS options. The values are reset at the next operation. As long as the certificate is being created, \" (computing) \" is displayed after the use case. You cannot cancel the create operation, but you can close the Security Screen and continue working. : Deletes the selected certificate If it is your own certificate, then the button opens a dialog which prompts you whether or not to keep the private key associated with the certificate. The answer Yes is set by default. Note that deleting the private key cannot be undone. : Upload selected certificate from the device and save on the PC. For CODESYS Control in Version 3.5.18.0 and higher, you can export PKCS#12 container files (certificate + key) from the controller if this has been permitted for the container. In this case, select a name, location, and file type ( *.p12 or *.pfx ) for the container file to be created in the local file system. The Export Certificate Container dialog opens where you specify a password for the container file. This kind of container can then be imported, for example, into the Own Certificates category on another controller (see above: toolbar on the left ). : Details about the selected certificate: Opens the Certificate dialog with the General tab, Details tab, and Certification Path tab : Renew the selected certificate. Opens the Certificate Settings dialog to create an additional new certificate for a certificate that will expire soon, with the same purpose and specified key length. The predefined values in the dialog are adapted, if necessary, depending on the selected certificate. : Generate the files <component>.csr for a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) which should be sent to a CA (Certificate Authority). This is an alternative to generating CSRs via the PLC shell and requires the corresponding permissions and at least CODESYS V3.5 SP17. The button opens the Certificate Signing Request Settings dialog. You can specify for which component (s) the CSR files should be generated and how the Coding should be ( ASN.1 or Base64 ). After you click OK to confirm, a message is displayed that the files are being created. You can see the status of the creation in the device log. To save the files to your computer, use the button.
