At the location in the code where an image is accessed, the image ID can then be briefly specified instead of the file name of the image. The centrally stored images are accessed primarily in visualizations. We recommend that you reduce the size of image files as much as possible before integrating them. This will optimize the loading time of the visualization in every visualization type: TargetVisu, WebVisu, and development system.

File Handling Remember the link Only the link is saved. This automatically updates a change to the image file in the image pool. You need to make sure that the path of the image file does not change. When saving the project as a project archive, the image file is embedded into the project archive.

This makes it possible to detect changes to the image file so that, if necessary, an update of the image can be made in the image pool. The behavior is controlled with the options in the next table. Note: Embedded image files increase the memory requirement of the project. Embed into project The image is added to the image pool. If the image file is changed again afterwards, then it is not updated in the project. For libraries, you need to embed the image into the project.
