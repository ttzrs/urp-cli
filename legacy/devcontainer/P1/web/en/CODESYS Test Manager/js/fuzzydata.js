This applies regardless of whether it is the 32-bit or 64-bit variant. The CODESYS Test Manager is the central component for test automation and its management. You can download the CODESYS Test Manager from CODESYS Store International or CODESYS Store North America . There you will also find the data sheet for the product. You can find the sample test scripts and the respective sample projects in the C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS Test Manager directory. This test script repository is preconfigured as \"Default Test Repository\" by default. To run the test scripts, you need to enable the user management of the controller and store the credentials in the test scripts. The sample scripts are created for a CODESYS Control Win controller (32 bit). If you use a different controller, then you need to adapt the parameters of the UpdateDevice script action.

"body" : "The CODESYS Test Manager is a testing framework for software written in CODESYS . You can use the testing framework to execute automated tests to verify the correctness of software at different test levels. The test is ranked according to the process model of software development, in which each stage of software development is subjected to a test. When you have decided at which level the test is to be performed, you can derive how your test should be implemented. System test The aim of a test can be to verify that an application, a library, or a communication connection is functioning correctly. Or you want to use a test to verify that a runtime system or a code generator will work error-free over a long time. In this case, the testee is a system. These kinds of tests are usually ranked as system tests. In the case of a system test, a system is fully tested with respect to both functional and non-functional requirements. The test environment simulates the subsequent production environment and should therefore be as realistic as possible. Integration test An integration test (interaction test) checks the collaboration of interdependent components. The test focuses on the interfaces of the components involved. The aim of the test is to verify correct results throughout entire processes. Unit test The aim of a test can be to verify that a chunk of code, a code snippet, or a programming unit in IEC language works correctly. In this case, the testee is the code. These kinds of tests are usually ranked as unit tests. A unit test (component test or module test) is at the level of the individual components of the software. The testee is the functionality within individual definable parts of the software (programs, function blocks, methods; and properties). The aim of the test is to verify the technical operability and to get correct professional results (also partial results). Unit tests are usually performed by the software developers themselves ( Test Driven Development ). You perform a system test by implementing a test script which performs a test run of test cases and test actions. The corresponding test project contains a compilable application with the system settings of the test system. You perform a unit test or an integration test by developing a test project which contains the testee and additional code that tests it. You can choose between implementing the test code formally as a test table or programmatically as a test POU or multitest POU. At the same time, you implement a suitable test script which contains the IEC Unit Test element. You may also be able to add test cases with actions. The IEC Unit Test element opens the test project when the test is executed and builds a test application from its code. In each case, you implement a test as an executable test script together with a test project. Then during the test run, the test cases are executed in the test system, evaluated, and a report is generated from the result. " },

"body" : "Example: Examples.CounterTest You can find the CODESYS sample projects Bspdt-TestManager and CounterTest in the C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS Test Manager directory. In a test script, you program the flow of test cases. A test case consists of test actions which are provided by test drivers. They cover many functionalities of CODESYS . You configure the test actions in the test element editor, without the need for special programming skills. Moreover, you can call IEC or IronPython scripts. When calling an IronPython script within a test script, the CODESYS scripting interface is used. Scripts can complete tasks which are not covered by the existing test drivers. For example, this is helpful for completing recurring routine tasks or for extending the functionality of the CODESYS Test Manager . When the test is executed, a test case is counts as passed when all of its test actions are executed without errors. You can configure the error handling for each test case and its test actions. As a whole, this kind of simple test script is well-suited for performing a system test, although you do not have access to the interfaces of a testee by means of test driver actions.

Create a test script and program the test flow in the test script with test cases and test actions. Note: Align the test project and test script.

These required instructions are made by a preparatory test case in the test script. The contents of the Generated unit tests folder are deleted in order to remove the generated POUs of a previous IEC unit test. The project and the Libraries to test are searched for test tables. Then the function blocks for executing the test tables are generated in the Generated unit tests folder. The project and the libraries that are listed on Libraries to test are searched for function blocks and programs that are marked as test. Then, of the detected programs and function blocks, those are removed which are excluded by the test categories or the name. The remaining programs and function blocks are used in the test. A backup of the original application is created. The test cases are inserted as IEC code in PLC_PRG . In the declaration and implementation, the added lines of code are marked with Generated by IEC Unit Test . If the application is too large for the controller, then the tests are subdivided automatically into several smaller applications. One or more executable applications are generated. The test is executed with the generated application(s). The following steps are processed: A test application is downloaded to the controller. The test application is started. The test cases are executed. If the string variable sInfo or wsInfo is used in the test function blocks, then its contents are included in the test report. The timeout is monitored. The test result is checked and then sent to the test report. The application is removed from the controller. A test report is generated containing all test results. Pay attention to the test repository Default-Test-Repository . The test script Examples.IecUnitTest is located there. In this test script, you can reconstruct an IEC unit test by loading the prepared steps to the project, updating the device, and configuring the communication settings. This is followed by an IEC unit test. The test cases that are processed originate from the Example_IecUnitTest project. The project is included in the installation directory: C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS Test Manager . The sample scripts are created for a CODESYS Control Win controller (32 bit).

Then there is a sequence of queries that varies the values of the diTestCaseIndex input from 0 to n-1 in order to request the sTestCaseName , sTestCaseCategories , and diTestCaseTimeout information for each test case. Each query is performed by the Test Manager in a closed cycle from xExecute := TRUE , wait for xDone , or xError and reset of the xExecute input to FALSE . Therefore, the test is executed as a sequence of closed cycles ( xExecute to xDone or xError ) that varies the diTestCaseIndex input from 0 to n-1 .

"body" : "Requirement: The test environment is prepared. The test project is open in the CODESYS Development System and the device settings and communication settings are configured. These required instructions are made by a preparatory test case in the test script. The contents of the Generated unit tests folder are deleted in order to remove the generated POUs of a previous IEC unit test. The project and the Libraries to test are searched for test tables. Then the function blocks for executing the test tables are generated in the Generated unit tests folder. The project and the libraries that are listed on Libraries to test are searched for function blocks and programs that are marked as test. Then, of the detected programs and function blocks, those are removed which are excluded by the test categories or the name. The remaining programs and function blocks are used in the test. A backup of the original application is created. The test cases are inserted as IEC code in PLC_PRG . In the declaration and implementation, the added lines of code are marked with Generated by IEC Unit Test . If the application is too large for the controller, then the tests are subdivided automatically into several smaller applications. One or more executable applications are generated. The test is executed with the generated application(s). The following steps are processed: A test application is downloaded to the controller. The test application is started. The test cases are executed. If the string variable sInfo or wsInfo is used in the test function blocks, then its contents are included in the test report. The timeout is monitored. The test result is checked and then sent to the test report. The application is removed from the controller. A test report is generated containing all test results. Pay attention to the test repository Default-Test-Repository . The test script Examples.IecUnitTest is located there. In this test script, you can reconstruct an IEC unit test by loading the prepared steps to the project, updating the device, and configuring the communication settings. This is followed by an IEC unit test. The test cases that are processed originate from the Example_IecUnitTest project. The project is included in the installation directory: C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS Test Manager . The sample scripts are created for a CODESYS Control Win controller (32 bit).

"body" : "The CBM.ETrigA and TM.Testcase_Base test POU implementations are still supported by version 5.0.0.0, but in future versions they might not be supported anymore. If you have test cases with old implementation and want to adapt them to the new implementation, then you need to consider the following points: When using CBM.ETrigA Use TM.Testcase ( Implementing a single test POU) instead. Derive a new POU from TM.Testcase and transfer the logic of the methods of the existing POU (to CBM.ETrigA ). For this purpose, use the wizard to create a new TM.Testcase . Enable all options so that all possible sample content is generated (template, comments, methods, etc.). In this way, you can easily see the differences. Larger parts of your existing test implementation can remain the same if you pay attention to the following conventions of TM.Testcase as opposed to the methods of CBM.ETrigA : The prvCyclicAction() , prvStart (), prvAbort( ), and prvResetOutputs() methods do not have to be overloaded in the TM.Testcase scheme. As a result, they cannot simply be copied from the CBM.ETrigA -based test POU to the TM.Testcase -based POU. Instead, only the contents of these methods may be copied and customized into the equivalents of the new TM.Testcase -based test POU, as explained below: Instead of the prvCyclicAction() method, Execute() is implemented: The SUPER call is omitted. SUPER^.prvCyclicAction() must no longer be called and instead also not SUPER^.Execute() . The VAR_OUTPUT xDone output must no longer be set directly. To signal the successful end of the test, the Execute() method has to return the value TRUE . Directly setting the error outputs VAR_OUTPUT xError and iErrorCode is still possible, but should be replaced by corresponding Assert Functions. We reserve the right to change the error outputs in future releases and plan to use the assert functions as a migration path. The sInfo output now has the type WSTRING and must no longer be declared explicitly: The string length of sInfo is now defined by the library parameter CONSTANTS.WSTRING_LENGTH . The sInfo output may still be written directly. However, when using assert functions, it can be mutually overwritten. Instead of the prvAbort() method, Abort() is implemented: The SUPER call is omitted. SUPER^.prvAbort() must no longer be called and instead also not SUPER^.Abort() . The xAbortInProgress variable no longer exists. Instead, the Abort() method has to return TRUE when the abort has ended. Attention: This has the inverted semantics to xAbortInProgress . Instead of the prvStart() method, Setup() is implemented: The SUPER call is omitted. SUPER^.prvStart() must no longer be called and instead also not SUPER^.Setup() . The Setup() method still does not have to return a value (it is ignored). Instead of the prvResetOutputs() method, TearDown() is implemented: The SUPER call is omitted. SUPER^.prvResetOutputs() must no longer be called and instead also not SUPER^.TearDown() . The TearDown() method still does not have to return a value (it is ignored). When using TM.Testcase_Base Use TM.Testcase instead. The TM.Testcase_Base was popularly used in the past to be able to define an sInfo output with more than 255 characters. The TM.Testcase had only one defined sInfo output with 255 characters. Now you can set the length of the sInfo output using the library parameter CONSTANTS.WSTRING_LENGTH . Derive directly from TM.Testcase instead of TM.Testcase_Base . However, you need to consider some points: Remove the custom sInfo output. Change the access to the sInfo of TM.Testcase to WSTRING (instead of STRING ) if the custom sInfo output was a STRING. Define the library parameter CONSTANTS.WSTRING_LENGTH of the Test Manager IEC Unit Test, 5.0.0.0 library (or newer) to the maximum required length. Test POUs, which have been fully implemented without a base and therefore comply exclusively with the interface convention, could also become incompatible in the future. It is always recommended to derive from TM.Testcase . " },

One test step is mapped per row in the test table. You configure a row by defining an input assignment and the expected output assignment for the testee. In this way, you can programmatically access the interfaces of the testee, as well as those of the test application or the system. The aim is to fully test the testee. As a consequence, the minimum number of test steps results from the combinatorics of the input assignments. The test script contains test cases which prepare the target system. Then the IEC Unit Test test element is called which triggers a mechanism to generate the actual test code. Example: Examples.CounterTestTable The CODESYS sample project CounterTestTable is included in the installation directory: C:\\ProgramData\\CODESYS Test Manager . During the test run, the test table is implicitly converted into test POUs and used for creating a test application together with the testee. This is executed on the controller. When this is done, an evaluation is performed as to whether or not the test steps are maintained. An IEC unit test counts as passed when all test steps are performed without any errors.

Declaration of categories Test POUs are categorized by adding the pragma {attribute 'testcategory' := '<categories>'} to their declaration and assigning a category name to the pragma attribute.

"body" : "Using the assert functions (asserts), you can easily check whether or not the response of the DUT corresponds to the expected response. This allows you to have the unit test implicitly respond to the test result. Every assert function returns a result of the check as BOOL, where TRUE means a successful check and FALSE means a failed check. Optionally, you could define an error text which is output as a message in case of an error. To check several different conditions one after the other, typically one assert call per condition is used as a single statement. If the condition of an assert call does not apply, then the error outputs of the test POU are automatically written accordingly and the following assert calls are no longer executed. Sometimes it can also be useful to use compound conditions in asserts, for example when the control flow of the test logic has to depend on several conditions. The only correct way to create a compound condition with asserts is to use the AND_THEN statement. IF (Assert_Bool_IsTrue(^THIS, value1, \"\") AND_THEN\n Assert_Bool_IsFalse(^THIS, value2, \"\")) THEN\n \/\/ do something\nEND_IF If you use a test POU of type ETrigA and want to use assert functions, then you need to implement the missing interfaces HandleAssertResult and HasError in the test POU.

The following applies for the status \"Commented Out\" of script elements and for set breakpoints: They only have an effect on Debug Script , not on the ordinary Execute Script . They are not stored in the test script \/ repository, but in the user options so that they exist only for the respective user and do not bother other editors\/PCs. Commands for debugging of test scripts are located in the Test progress dialog. A script can be processed in single steps. In doing so, you can monitor variables of the current scope and view the previous errors. Before executing the script, you can exclude individual elements of the script from processing in debug mode by commenting them out and setting breakpoints. Breakpoints can be disabled temporarily and, for example, used as bookmarks. Stepping in debug mode In the Test scripts view, select the script that you want to debug. In the context menu or in the Test Manager menu, click Debug Script . The Test progress dialog opens. The status Halted is displayed in the status bar. Halt on error is enabled. Set the desired behavior as needed by means of the Auto collapse , Auto scroll , and Halt on error buttons. Click the button to execute the next test element in the script and halt again afterwards. The status changes to Stepping for the duration of the processing. A line is displayed in the view with the contents of the processing. The result of the processing step is indicated at the beginning of the line in parentheses. Example: (successful) CloseProject If errors occur, then the error messages are displayed on the Errors tab of the dialog. You can copy the error messages from there to the clipboard ( Ctrl + C ). On the Variables (scope #<id>) tab, you can view the variables affected in the test step, including their parameters, values, and scope. For example, when you switch from an action to a call while stepping, the scope also changes. Click the button if you want to run the test script without halting (continue), or click the button to halt before executing the next test element. The current status of the test processing is always displayed in the lower left in the status of the dialog. When the test script is processed completely, the Test progress dialog closes.

"body" : "IEC Unit Test Symbol: Function : The IEC Unit Test element is used for automatically searching the (preparatory) loaded test project for test POUs and test tables, and then creating a test application from them. Then this test application is loaded, started, and the tests are performed. Finally, the results are saved in a test report. The requirement is that the test project contains test POUs or test tables. Title Title of the IEC unit test, which appears in the test report The title may contain spaces. Example: IEC Unit Test of Feature A Device read timeout (ms) Maximum waiting time (in ms) during communication with the controller If the time is exceeded, then error handling is started and an error is issued. For example, the timeout is monitored when variables are monitored. Example: 5000 Note: During the test run, the timeout is monitored continuously: usually when logging in, when the application status is read out. Then for each single test case execution (at least once), when status and results are read. Login retries Number of login attempts If the number is exceeded, then error handling is started and an error is issued. Libraries to test List of libraries that contain test POUs These library POUs are instantiated, executed, and evaluated automatically in the test application during the test run. Double-click in the table in the top free row in the respective column to open an input field. Name Library which is integrated in the test project by at least one library administrator Their referencing type have to match the information in the Library Manager. Alternatively, a variable could also be specified for the library name. Library name (for absolute or asterisk referencing) Example: Test Collection Feature ABC Placeholder name (with prepended # ) As a result, the Version and Company settings are blank. Requirement: The library is also referenced by means of placeholders in the Library Manager. Example: #Test Collection Feature ABC Test script variable (in braces) which contains a library name Example: {TestLibABC} Version Absolute version information Requirement: The library is also referenced absolutely in the Library Manager. Example: 4.0.0.0 * Asterisk referencing to always reference the newest version Requirement: The library is also referenced in the Library Manager by means of an asterisk. Blank (already determined by placeholders) Test script variable (in braces) containing the version Example: {TestLibABCVersion} Company Example: Company ABC Blank (already determined by placeholders) Test script variable (in braces) containing the version Example: {TestLibABCCompany} Selected categories and Excluded categories Both input fields are used to restrict the selection of POUs to be included in the test run. You can specify Selected categories explicitly and\/or Excluded categories of POUs explicitly. If no explicitly selected category is specified, then the test POUs of all categories are selected implicitly. The list of excluded categories is applied based on this selection. Excluded function blocks are not instantiated, executed, or evaluated during the test run. This allows you to customize the test case at script level, for example to use it for controllers with different hardware. Requirement: The test POUs or test tables contained in the test project have declared test categories. A test POU is categorized by the pragma {attribute 'testcategory' := '<name1|, name2>'} . Example: {attribute 'testcategory' := 'BasicTests'} Double-click on the left in the top free row to open an input field. You can specify the name of one or (comma-separated) multiple POU categories per line. Example: BasicTests, ExtTests A dynamic configuration of the POU categories to be included or excluded is possible by means of placeholders. The placeholder consists of the name of a test variable enclosed in braces. This test variable is assigned one or more category names and\/or POU names by means of an assignment in the test script. Example: In the test script, you assign a POU category BasicTests to the test variable TMCatVar : TMCatVar := \"BasicTests\" . In the Selected categories field of the IEC Unit Test test element, you specify the placeholder: {TMCatVar} . As a result, only the POUs of the BasicTests category are included explicitly in the test run. Example of a combined input in the Selected categories field: {TMCatVar}, {TMExtTests}, CTD Selected functions and Excluded functions Both input fields are used to restrict the selection of POUs to be included in the test run. Specify either Selected functions explicitly or Excluded functions explicitly. These lists are evaluated in addition to the Selected categories and Excluded categories lists described above. You can specify the POU name or the test case name, which has been defined with the compiler directive {attribute 'testcasename' := '<name>'} as the input. Uppercase and lowercase are not taken into consideration. In addition, the following wildcards are possible: '*' for any number of characters; '?' for a single character. Example: All of the following input will result in the execution of the POU with the name TestCase_01 . Selected functions: TestCase_01\ntc1\ntc?\nTestCase_0*\n*_01 Declaration: {attribute 'test'}\n{attribute 'testcasename':='tc1'}\n{attribute 'testcasetimeout' := '60000'}\nFUNCTION_BLOCK TestCase_01 EXTENDS TM.Testcase\nVAR_INPUT\nEND_VAR\nVAR_OUTPUT\nEND_VAR\nVAR\nEND_VAR\n\nsuper^(); Excluded function blocks are not instantiated, executed, or evaluated during the test run. In this way, you can control the execution of the test case at the script level. For example, you can control the execution of a test case for controllers with different hardware. For input and input syntax, see the section above: Selected categories and Excluded categories . In the case of multitests, values of the wsTestCaseName variable can be specified in the Excluded functions input field. As a result, the test cases of all POUs with these variable values are excluded from the test. Example: The test cases with the variable value \"TestStep #0: Initial value\" are not executed Excluded functions: TestStep #0: Intial value Implementation: CASE diTestCaseIndex OF\n 0: \/\/ Test Case #0 - tests the same as CTD_InitialValue \n IF THIS^.xGetTestInfo THEN\n \/\/ Test case header\n THIS^.wsTestCaseName := \"TestStep #0: Intial value\";\n THIS^.wsTestCaseCategories := \"Multitest\";\n THIS^.diTestCaseTimeout := 200;\n xDone := TRUE;\n ELSE\n ... Single application mode : In the test project, the device Backup is generated instead of an application Backup . On some devices, especially embedded devices, only one application is permitted. They are not able to process multiple applications. Similarly, only one application per device is permitted in the device tree of the test project. To generate a compilable test project, a backup device is created for these devices instead of a backup application (backup copy of the original application named Backup ). Then there is a copy of the device named Backup in the device tree. After that, the changes required for test generation changes are made in the project. Note: Select this option also for devices whose application name cannot be changed. Then the device in the project is renamed, not the applications. " },

Example: iVar = 1 In the test script editor, a conditional test action is identified by displaying the condition in parentheses after the test action. Example: (condition iVar = 1) Note: If you use a test script variable in the expression, then you need to specify the variable with a placeholder operator. Example: {TempPath} = 'D:\\Temp' Delay&Retries Initial delay [ms] Time span (in milliseconds) after which the test action starts Max. retries Maximum number of repetitions until the action is evaluated with Succeeded Maximum value: 100 An action is repeated until it is evaluated as Succeeded or the number of Max. retries is reached.

If an exception occurs during the test, then its name is stored in the variable. The variable is available for additional referencing (for example, in a Python script). Expected exceptions Expected exceptions are those that have to occur during test execution. The test action is evaluated with Succeeded only then. Exception type Example: System.Exception : Opens a list box with the possible types Exception TestFailedException TestExecutionException InvalidOperationException Match type Example: Exact : Opens a list box with the possible types Subclass The exception corresponds to a subclass of the required exception type. Exact The exception corresponds to the required exception type. Exception message Text While the test is running, the test is compared to the exception in order to check whether or not it is the expected exception. The check type you selected in Match Message is taken into account. Note: Variable substitution is supported by {<variable>} . If messages contain braces, then variable substitution has to be suppressed. In this case, specify double braces: {{<text>}} } Match Message Example: Exact : Opens a list box with the possible check types Check types: Ignore : The message text is not checked. Exact : The message text exactly corresponds to the predefined text in Exception Message . Substring : The message text contains the predefined text in Exception Message .

Gateway name Name of the gateway : Opens the gateway selection dialog You can apply the data of a selected gateway to the configuration. Use one of the following four options to scan the network for the target device to which the connection should be established. The two restriction options below can be used to refine the search when the operation is performed by means of Target address , Target name , or Local PLC . Target address New CODESYS address to be set in the format \"[0101.A185]\" The network is scanned for the address specified here. With the possible restrictions regarding device type and device ID listed below, the detected selection of target devices in the network can be refined even more. However, if more than one device is detected nevertheless, then an attempt is made to establish a connection to the first device in the list of detected devices. Target name The network is scanned for target devices with this name which are running at least one PLC instance. The CODESYS address of the PLC instance is stored in the device object. The Restrict to device type and Restrict to device ID options can be used to fine-tune the search. If, however, more than one result is found, then it is likely that more than one PLC instance is running on a device. Then the desired instance can be selected using Specify instance of PLC . If this is not specified, then an attempt is made to connect using the first search result. Local PLC The computer where the test script is executed is scanned for PLC instances. The CODESYS address of the PLC instance is stored in the device object. The Restrict to device type and Restrict to device ID options can be used to fine-tune the search. If, however, more than one result is found, then it is likely that more than one PLC instance is running on a device. Then the desired instance can be selected using Specify instance of PLC . If this is not specified, then an attempt is made to connect using the first search result. Target IP\/DNS IP address or DNS name of the target device Optionally, the port can also be specified. Examples: 192.168.0.1:1170 , <host name>:1170 Note: With this option, the network is not scanned, but the IP address is stored directly in the device object. Therefore, no additional restriction to device type or device ID is possible. As a result, no check is performed before establishing the actual connection as to whether or not the specified device really exists or matches the device description. Specify instance of PLC : If multiple CODESYS runtime systems are running on the same system or network, then the instance which should be used can be specified here (list box). The instances are sorted in ascending order by the CODESYS target device address. Restrict to device type Specifies the scanned device type, which is stored in the device description and which is displayed when manually scanning the network Example: 4096 This additional information is applied as a restriction after the network has been scanned according to the information specified above for Target address , Target name , or Local PLC . Restrict to device ID Specifies the scanned device ID, which is stored in the device description and which is displayed when manually scanning the network Example: 00000001 This additional information is applied as a restriction after the network has been scanned according to the information specified above for Target address , Target name , or Local PLC . Encrypted communication certificate What should happen when encrypted communication is required and the target device has a certificate for it? Do not trust certificate automatically : A dialog opens asking whether or not the certificate should be trusted or not. Connect to device immediately and trust certificate : The certificate is trusted for the duration of the test run and a connection to the device is established immediately. Trust certificate with next connection : The certificate is trusted for the duration of the test run at the next connection setup. " },

"body" : "Assignments of literals   Expressions can be used together with Choose elements to implement control flows: Create a new test script. Add an Assignment element with the following contents: four := 4 Explanation: This expression assigns the value 4 to the variable four Variables must not be inside curly brackets. The value 4 is a numeric literal. It must not be placed inside curly brackets. Assignments of expressions   In addition to constant values, the results of expressions can also be assigned. Add an Assignment element to the test script with the following contents: thirtySix := (4 + 5) * four Explanation: The result of the expression (36) is assigned to the variable  thirtySix Neither of the two variables may be inside curly brackets. Because the variables contain numerical values, they can be used with arithmetic operations (+, -, *, \/). The order of arithmetic operations corresponds to the usual mathematical order (multiplication before addition). Arithmetic operators   In addition to the + and * operators, there are also other operators. List of all operators: +   -   \/   MOD   DIV   Add two more Assignment elements to the test script with the following contents: real := thirtySix MOD 11 DIV 2 \/ 4.0\ninteger := thirtySix MOD 11 DIV 2 \/ four Explanation: The MOD operator stands for modulo operation and always returns an integer value. The expression thirtySix MOD 11 therefore results in the value 3. The DIV operator stands for integer division and always returns an integer value. The expression \"3 DIV 2\" therefore results in the value 1. The operator \/ stands for floating-point division and returns a real value if the divisor is a real value. If the divisor is an integer value, then it returns an integer value. The expression 1 \/ 4.0 therefore results in 0.25, while the expression 1 \/ 4 results in return the value 0. The operators MOD , DIV , and \/ have the same mathematical order of operations as multiplication. The expressions are evaluated from left to right. Consequently, the expression thirtySix MOD 11 DIV 2 \/ 4.0 yields the value 0.25 and the expression thirtySix MOD 11 DIV 2 \/ four yields the value 0. Arithmetic operators with a real value always yield a real value as the result. MOD and DIV can be used only with integer values. " },

Add three more Assignment elements to the test script with the following contents: boolValue := true\nor := boolValue OR false\nor := false OR false Explanation: Boolean values can also be assigned to variables. Variables can also be used in logical expressions. They must not be inside curly brackets. OR results in true when at least one side of the operator is true . If both sides are false , then OR also results in false . " },

Example: T#10s Categories Comma-separated list of category names A POU to be tested can be identified with a category by means of the pragma {attribute 'testcategory' := '<category name>,<category name>'} . If the category name is specified in Excluded categories in the configuration editor of an IEC unit test, then test cases belonging to the category are excluded from the test. Example: {attribute 'testcategory' := 'BasicTest, CTDTest'} Test Case Timeout Default timeout for all test cases Specified as IEC time constants: TIME or LTIME This value is used when a test case has not defined a timeout. Example: T#3s Failure mode Global reaction of the test in case of error Possible settings: Use standard : The standard reaction currently cannot be changed and means that the test run is aborted. Abort test case Abort test case group Abort unit test Abort test run Forces Definition of variables to be forced You can create a list of variables and values with entries in the Variable and Value columns. The variables are then set to the specified value in each controller cycle. Test case-related \"forces\" overwrite global \"forces\" for the same variable. Example: PLC_PRG.countVar := 10 Invariants A set of conditions can be defined here, which have to be tested in each controller cycle, in addition to the test of the \"testee\". This is useful for tests in which the environment state of the application is also relevant. If the condition is not fulfilled, then the system reacts according to Failure mode . The condition is formulated as an IEC expression with variables that can be accessed from within the application. Example: Variable : GVL_g.resTemp , Type : := , Value : 10 , Tolerance : 2 " },

Name Test step name Created automatically when added Example: („ Step1 „, „ Step2 „, …) Duration Duration of the test step Single : The test step is executed for exactly one cycle. This is the default setting when a duration is not specified explicitly. Cycles : Number of cycles in which the test step is executed The minimum is one cycle, which corresponds to the Single option. Time : The test step is executed over the specified time span. In the first cycle, a time stamp is applied and compared with the specified time span in each subsequent cycle. If the time is detected to be exceeded during this test, then the system switches to the next test step. The time value is specified as a constant TIME constant (for example, T#5s ). : Opens the Custom conditions for duration dialog Call : The test step is called one time. This is necessary if a value for an input variable is defined in the conditions of the test step. : The test step is not called. This may be necessary if the call influences the test result. A use case for deactivation results when there is a custom condition for the duration. For example, if you want to check a function block developed according to the CAA Behaviour Model. A possible test would be whether or not the output xBusy becomes FALSE and xDone becomes TRUE . This case can be implemented in two test steps: Step 1: Check for xBusy = TRUE with a custom duration This duration is the condition xDone = TRUE . Step 2: Check for xBusy = FALSE without a call Note: If called again, then xBusy would immediately become TRUE . <variable 1> You can create any number of columns for variables to be written and read in a test step in one row. These variables are typically the inputs and outputs of the testee, but can also be other variables (for example, system states). An input can be recognized in the column by the IEC assignment operator := , an output at an IEC comparison operator (for example, = , < , or > ). The table columns for the individual function block variables can already have been created when the Test Table object was inserted. The columns can be supplemented, reduced, and edited at any time using the Edit columns dialog. Input variables of the function block to be tested are inserted as the Assignment column type. In the case of Boolean inputs, predefined assignments are then available in the column of the tabular editor. Output variables of the function block to be tested are inserted as the Condition column type. For these kinds of columns, the comparison operators are then provided in the tabular editor in order to formulate the test condition. For possible operators, see below. Conditions (as the IEC expression column type) Depending on the column type (input or output variable), a corresponding list of choices is provided in the column of the tabular editor for setting the condition for the variable. For output variables, you can also define a separate failure mode (error handling) for each test case. Note: The check condition consists of the sum of all tests of the output variables. The configured test condition has to be fulfilled for the entire duration of the test step. " },

Later, the test case execution can be conditionally controlled based on the names of test cases. In addition, the name is displayed in the test report. Type Extend TM.Testcase (recommended) This template provides an easy-to-use scheme for a single test case. It consists of a series of methods and outputs to perform test-specific tasks. When the test is executed, the methods of the POU are called in the following order: Setup() (optional, one-time call) provides the capability to prepare the testee and test. Execute() (required, called in the loop) is used to stimulate the testee and check its results. The method is called until it returns TRUE . To report failure or success, Assert Functions is used. The Info VAR_OUTPUT of the POU can also be used to add textual details to the test report, but they could be mutually overwritten by assert functions. Teardown() (optional, one-time call) provides the capability to clean up and reset the test after it has finished. Abort() : If the test POU is aborted by setting the VAR_INPUT xAbort to TRUE , then this method is called repeatedly until it returns TRUE . This provides the capability to clean up a running test even if it is aborted. The IEC Unit Test test element aborts a test POU, for example, when the timeout for the test case has elapsed. Extend TM.BaseMultiTest This scheme is suitable for the implementation of a series of test cases. The interface of the scheme (see TM.BaseMultiTest ) is called multiple times in different contextual phases for each individual test case. The template assigns the following tasks to the IFBCommand methods of CBM.ETrigA : prvStart() (optional, one-time call) provides the capability to prepare the testees and test. prvCyclicAction() (required, called in the loop) is the location to stimulate the testee and check its results. This method is called multiple times in different contextual phases for each individual test case: Before the actual test execution (input xGetTestInfo := FALSE ), information is collected about the individual test cases of the POU. In this phase, the input xGetTestInfo has the value TRUE . With the value -1 at the diTestCaseIndex input, the number of test cases is queried at the diTestCaseCount output. Then there is a sequence of queries which varies the values of the diTestCaseIndex input from 0 to n-1 in order to query the TestCaseName , TestCaseCategories , and diTestCaseTimeout information for each test case. Each query is performed by the Test Manager in a closed cycle of xExecute := TRUE , waiting for xDone = TRUE . or xError = TRUE and resetting the xExecute input to FALSE . Therefore, the test is executed as a sequence of closed cycles ( xExecute to xDone or xError ) which varies the diTestCaseIndex input from 0 to n-1 . In doing so, the xGetTestInfo input is always left at the value FALSE . To report failure or success, Assert Functions is used here. The Info VAR_OUTPUT of the POU can also be used to add textual details to the test report, but they could be mutually overwritten by assert functions. prvAbort() is called repeatedly when the xAbort input of the POU is TRUE and until the xAbortInProgress VAR of the POU is set to FALSE . This provides the capability to clean up a running test in every state. Add optional methods According to the type, adds the standard methods, which are marked as optional above, for setting up, canceling, and resetting the function block. Add implementation template Fills all generated methods with a sample implementation of a test case which uses \"TODO\" comments to make it clear where custom test logic should be used. This option is recommended when a test case is completely rewritten. Add explanatory comments Inserts a code comment, which explains the basic operation of the POU pattern, in the declaration part of the test case function block and each of its methods. This option is recommended if the pattern is not yet known. Optional Attributes Test Case Name A name for the test case, which is then used instead of the name of the POU. For more information, see: Pragmas in Test POUsTest Case Category A comma-separated list of categories which the test case belongs to. Later, the test case execution can be conditionally controlled based on the categories of test cases. For more information, see: Pragmas in Test POUsTest Case Timeout The time which the test case may take to execute. If the test case takes longer, then it is aborted and the abort method is called if necessary. With value 0 , the timeout can be set to infinite. Test Case Group Adds the testcasegroup attribute in the declaration part Test Case Group Timeout Adds the testcasegrouptimeout attribute in the declaration part " },

As a result, the test environment is ready for the actual tests: The test cases programmed in the script are executed and evaluated automatically. Finally, steps are necessary to clean up the test environment and close it. Controller Device or controller where the testing is performed Test application Application which is also created automatically to perform an IEC unit test The application contains test code, either generated from test POUs or from a test table. Requirement: The test script contains a unit test. Then, when the script is started, the test application is created automatically from test POUs or from the test table. If necessary, multiple test applications are created and loaded. Context: Test management Test repository Location for scripts and their reports You can create any number of test repositories, for example to manage tests for different CODESYS versions in different repositories. Test script Executable script (program in scripting language) which tests the software The script calls test cases and test actions that are based on a test driver. These kinds of tests are usually system tests. In a unit test, the test code is executed and evaluated. The result is summarized as a test report. Report Summarized documentation of the test results Context: Test element Test element Example: Test action Call \/ remote call Test element for calling another test script Choice Test element for branching one script into two script segments Assignment Test element for assigning a configured value to a test script variable Test case Test element for structuring test actions in a logical unit Test action Test element for executing the configured command of a test driver IEC Unit Test Test element for creating a test application when a test is executed in order to execute test code The test application is based on a test project which contains either test tables, test POUs, or multitest POUs. Context: Test action Test Driver Collection of test actions (IEC program code) available for automatically controlling a CODESYS instance With test actions, the test application is prepared, controlled, checked, evaluated, cleaned up, and the result is documented. The following test drivers are available: Objects Online Devices Monitoring FileIO Testreprot Scripting Projects System Context: Test code in the project Test table Object in which a testee is tested with a list of the test steps (ideally in its entirety) Therefore, the test script contains the IEC Unit Test test element. Testee Function block as a software unit (software unit, software component) which is tested during the IEC unit test based on a test table Input assignment Specific set of values for the input variables (and any state variables) Output assignment Specific set of values for all output variables which occur in the corresponding input assignment Test step Row in the test table where an input assignment and the corresponding output assignment are configured Test case Row in the test table for structuring test steps in a logical unit Group Row in the test table for structuring test cases in a logical unit Test POU Function block or program which contains test code in any IEC language and is decorated with the pragma {attribute 'test'} The test POU is part of the project (test project) which is loaded during the test run. Therefore, the test script contains the IEC Unit Test test element. Multitest POU Function block or program where test code is implemented in an IEC language and which is decorated with the pragma {attribute 'test' := 'multitest'} The test POU is part of the project (test project) which is loaded during the test run.
