"body" : "A PROFINET Controller opens a separate connection (AR = Application Relation) to each individual PROFINET Device for the purpose of data exchange, parameterization, and diagnosis. The devices are identified by the PROFINET station name. A PROFINET Device is structured by submodules which are addressed by slot\/subslot. Therefore, for example, the communication module with the Ethernet interface is module 0 and contains the interface submodule and several port submodules for each Ethernet port. Slot\/module are containers for the submodules to which the actual IO data and parameters (data records, addressed via index) are assigned. In the case of cyclic data exchange, PROFINET follows the provider–consumer model. This means that both the IO Controller and the IO Device send the cyclic data independently on their own. A mutual monitoring of the send clock takes place. Exceeding the allowed limit will cause the connection to be terminated. Together with the actual IO data of a submodule, status information (provider and consumer status) is transmitted in each case. A PROFINET Device sending alarms to the PROFINET Controller to notify about the coming and going of interruptions. PROFINET defines a comprehensive diagnosis model for this, which includes, for example, hardware defects (broken cable), network interruption, or device-specific events. Acyclic services (DCE RPC via UDP\/IP) are used for the transmission of configuration data, asset data, and diagnosis data. " },

The controller uses a DCP set command to set the desired IP address of the PROFINET Device. The controller sends a connect request (RPC protocol) to the device. This request contains a list of submodules with which the controller wants to exchange data. The PROFINET Device compares the list of expected submodules with the actual available submodules. In the case of a deviation, the connect response contains the \"Module-Diff-Block\" with the non-matching modules. The controller transfers the configured parameters\/settings of the submodules. The PROFINET Device applies the parameterization after a complete transmission to the internal logic (device application) and the hardware of the submodules. After the configuration is complete, the PROFINET Device uses the application-ready request to report to the controller about the readiness for data exchange. Both participants switch the status of the transmitted IO data to valid, provided there is no fault at the respective submodule. " },

"body" : "The configuration of the PROFINET Controller consists of the controller and the PROFINET devices (Slaves) inserted below it. The devices are configured by the controller and exchange data with it. CODESYS provides two different PROFINET Controllers: A variant especially for Hilscher CIFX-Karten A variant which is hardware-independent, the CODESYS PROFINET Controller. This variant runs on any number of Ethernet adapters. When inserting the Ethernet-based controller, two tasks are created implicitly that are required by the PROFINET communication stack. Profinet_CommunicationTask : This task includes the acyclic communication services, such as establishing connections and diagnostics. These services are not time-critical due to very weak real-time demands. Therefore the task is low priority. Profinet_IOTask : This is where the actual PROFINET real-time data exchange takes place. Pending IO data packets are processed in each cycle (see Slave Configurator: Send clock ). Therefore, a cycle time of 1ms is required (for 1ms send clock). If the smallest selected sender interval for the slaves of this controller is 2ms, 4ms, or greater, then also a cycle time of 2ms or 4 ms can be selected. However, the priority of the task should be selected as high as possible. (1) Controller – NetX Configuration(2) Device – General(3) Module – General(4) Ethernet adapter (5) Controller – GeneralFor maximum IO performance with minimum delay when reading\/writing, IO data can be updated in this task (→ insert own POU which updates the IOs in this task). No blocking or persisting operations should be executed in the IO task, such as visualization or file access. If the task is blocked too long, then the watchdog cancels the connection for communicating with the slave. We recommend that you activate the Refresh I\/Os in Stop option in the PLC settings. Otherwise the communication is canceled when the application stops at a breakpoint. With the scan functionality, you can easily ascertain the present hardware structure and transmit to the device tree. " },

CODESYS Default values – PROFINET Substitute values PROFINET Devices set their inputs and outputs to predefined substitute values when there is an interruption. These values are defined in the field device in contrast with default values. These values are usually \"0\", but specific substitute values can also be configured depending on the device. The substitute values are set in the following cases: The connection is interrupted. The controller sets the provider state for the incoming data to \"BAD\". Other interruptions occur (for example, exception in host application, incorrect parameterization) If the Application stop --> Substitute values option is enabled, then the controller sets the provider states to \"BAD\" at application stop. In this case, the slaves set their substitute values. All incoming data from the controller is ignored (including default values). If the default values defined in the application should be set for an application stop, then you need to disable this option. Moreover, you should select the Update IO while stop option (in the PLC Settings ). Otherwise, the CODESYS PROFINET Controller is stopped. " },

It is used for unique identification of the device in the network. Station status 32-bit error code compliant with the PROFINET specification. In case of error, the status is provided here, for example, when establishing a connection fails or a link is interrupted. A description is also displayed. IP Parameters IP address The IP settings of the device. Set when establishing the connection to the controller. Subnet mask The subnet mask used by the device. Default gateway The default gateway used by the device. Communication Settings Send clock (ms) Send clock (in milliseconds). Reduction ratio Scaling factor The send cycle is defined by Send clock * Reduction ratio . Therefore, a Send clock of 1ms and a Reduction ratio of 4 means that IO data is sent every 4ms. Phase With a Reduction ratio of n , the send cycle is divided into phases 1 to n (where data is sent in one phase only). You can determine in which phase the data is sent for the purpose of load distribution. If Send clock = 1 and Reduction ratio = 4 (as in the example above), then you could configure phases 1–4. For four slaves with this send clock and reduction ratio settings, you could assign one of the four phases to each of the four slaves. In this way, only one data package is sent in each of the four phases of the send cycle and the load is distributed equally. Data hold time (ms) Monitoring time. A multiple of the send cycle (send cycle = Send Clock * Reduction Ratio ). Possible values: 3 ms – 1920 ms.

With the PROFINET system redundancy, both controllers each maintain a connection (AR = application relation) to each PROFINET field device which supports S2 system redundancy. One of the connections has the PRIMARY role, and the other connection has the BACKUP role. Here, only the connection with the PRIMARY role transmits valid data.

"body" : "In the project, the settings such as IP address and controller station name for the PROFINET controller also need to be configured on the second controller (PLC 2). When the Redundancy Configuration object is inserted into the project, there are additional settings for the EtherNet Adapter on PLC 2 at the EtherNet Adapter device. In the configuration of the controller, an additional System Redundancy tab is displayed for the settings which should be used on PLC 2. Field devices which support S2 system redundancy are automatically set to this mode. The CODESYS Redundancy allows only the synchronization of a single task. In this task, all PROFINET I\/O data should be used, whereby the I\/O mapping should be done only to existing variables. Because only the PROFINET controller with the PRIMARY connection receives valid I\/O data, no PROFINET I\/O data should be processed on a BACKUP controller. PROFINET function blocks for acyclic services (for example, RDREC , WRREC ) or alarm processing (for example, RALARM ) must not be used within the synchronized task or the synchronized data areas. The priority of the redundant task must be significantly lower than that of the PROFINET I\/O task. The standard behavior of the PROFINET controller during operation: When the role of the controller is \"Active\", the PROFINET controller (and all connections) are PRIMARY . When the role of the controller is \"Standby\", the PROFINET controller (and all connections) are BACKUP . When the role of the controller is \"Standalone\" at the time of startup, only the PROFINET controller on PLC 1 is the PRIMARY controller. When the role of the controller changes to \"Standalone\" (redundancy connection interrupted or failure of the other PLC), the PROFINET controller retains its current role. The RedundancyManager function block extends the standard behavior with useful error handling: When the connections of a PRIMARY controller are terminated (complete shutdown of all connections or single connection termination), the standby controller switches to \"Active\" and its PROFINET controller becomes the new PRIMARY controller. When the PROFINET controller on one of the two controllers has a failure (for example, no network), this controller is switched to \"Simulation\". Attention: The RedundancyManager must not be defined in a synchronized area, but for example in a global variable list. " },

"body" : "Media redundancy (based on MRP – Media Redundancy Protocol) is a function for increasing the system availability by means of redundant communication paths. Standard Ethernet allows for only a single, unique data path (line and star topologies) to one network participant. MRP allows for the physical closing of a line topology to one ring. As a result, the participant can be reached over two paths. All participants of an MRP ring (also: \"MRP domain\") have to be configured as a media redundancy client (MRC) and at least one of them as a media redundancy manager (MRM). If there is no physical malfunction of the rings, then the MRM interrupts the ring to prevent an infinite loop of Ethernet data. When a malfunction is detected, the MRM opens the ring and the participants in the disconnected network segment can be reached again. Media redundancy can be combined with other redundancy mechanisms such as system redundancy. It is possible to configure multiple rings and (if the devices support it) also multiple configured rings. Devices that do not support MRP themselves can be attached to an MRP ring as passive participants (from an MRP perspective). One example is an MRP ring of switches to which the remaining participants are attached as in a classic star topology. Media redundancy is negotiable for standard Ethernet protocols and therefore not limited to PROFINET communication. Configuration \/ Commissioning: In the topology editor, configure the port switching of the PROFINET Devices. In the simplest case, a real existing line topology, which is not yet closed to the ring, can also be imported into the project using the import function. Then close the ring in the configuration. Result: Activate the ring and configure a participant as the Manager or multiple participants as Manager_Auto . On the Media Redundancy tab, a closed ring with the participants is displayed. Download the project to the controller. The PROFINET Devices are parameterized with the MRP configuration at start-up. As long as the ring has not been closed physically, the MRM displays a diagnosis \"MRP Ring open\". After successful configuration, you can now close the ring physically. In the case that the ring is interrupted, the reconfiguration of the ring may cause a temporary interruption of the PROFINET communication. This is the case when the interruption is longer than the watchdog time set for the PROFINET connection. This time depends on the number of devices (maximum of 50 devices per ring) as well as the type of device. The total time is always less than 200ms and can also be significantly shorter. " },

This is currently possible only with RTE Vx >= V3.5 SP9, as well as Linux and Hilscher kernel module. Specific steps should be noted during configuration: The IRT communication is activated by setting the RT class of a PROFINET Slave to RTC 3. For all IRT devices (\"IRT domains\"), the network topology (that is, the connectivity of the Ethernet ports) must be recognized internally. This setting is performed in the Topology tab of the PROFINET Master. In addition, the cable length between the devices must be defined. A default value of 100m is specified. This setting is performed in the Options tab of the PROFINET Device. A mixed operation between RT and IRT is possible. However, the IRT domains must not be interrupted by RT devices or non-IRT capable switches. This means that the IRT devices at the controller follow immediately \"after\" the RT devices.

"body" : "IO-Link devices such as PROFINET Modules or Devices with the IO-Link Master Function (IOLM) and connected IO-Link Devices (IOLD, for example sensors) can be used in principle without additional measures. PROFINET defines the IO-Link profile for this, which describes the mapping of the IO-Link objects and functions to PROFINET submodules: IO data of the IO-Link devices are mapped to the IO data of these proxy submodules. Acyclic PROFINET services are used for sending IO-Link commands and transmitting parameters (see FBs in ProfinetCommon\/IO-Link). IO-Link events and diagnoses are mapped to PROFINET alarms and diagnosis data. Manufacturer-specific tools (PDCT – Port and Device Configuration Tool) have to be used then to perform the often very complicated parameterization of IO-Link devices. CODESYS also provides a separate licensed IO-Link plug-in. This plug-in contains configurators which use the IO-Link device descriptions (IODD) to allow for convenient parameterization. Moreover, the generic (which mean transmitted as a byte stream) IO data of the IO-Link devices is prepared with the description data from the IODD. Another advantage is the backup of the IO-Link device parameters in the CODESYS project. For the configuration by means of a CODESYS IO-Link, the IODD has to be imported, and the resulting generated IO-Link device has to be inserted below the IOLD proxy submodule in the device tree. When an IODD Device is added below an IOLD proxy submodule, an IO-Link Integration tab is displayed for this object. More settings are possible there. Download IODD-IO configuration : The IODD device is not only used for the configuration (IO-Link parameter), but also downloaded to the controller. An additional I\/O mapping is generated which, instead of the generic byte stream, provides an I\/O mapping which is prepared with information from the IODD. The generic inputs at the PROFINET submodule are still available. Any existing inputs at the PROFINET submodule are no longer evaluated for reasons of consistency. Adapt provider ID and device ID : The provider ID and device ID in the PROFINET submodule settings are automatically adapted to the subordinate IODD device. " },

CODESYS provides two different PROFINET Field Devices: A variant especially for Hilscher CIFX-Karten A variant which is hardware-independent, the CODESYS PROFINET Field Device This variant runs on any number of Ethernet adapters and is also available in a purely programmatically configurable variant. When inserting the Ethernet-based CODESYS Field Device, two tasks are created implicitly that are required by the PROFINET communication stack. Profinet_CommunicationTask : This task includes the acyclic communication services, such as establishing connections and diagnostics. These services are not time-critical due to very weak real-time demands. Therefore the task is low priority. Profinet_IOTask : This is where the actual PROFINET real-time data exchange takes place. Pending IO data packets are processed in each cycle (see Slave Configurator: Send clock ). Therefore, a cycle time of 1ms is required (for 1ms send clock).

Common causes for aborting of the connection Powersafe policy Modern operating systems and CPUs typically have numerous energy-saving features which \"sleep\" parts of the system (CPU or network adapter). \"Waking up\" those components can be delayed so that sending can no longer be done reliably. Curiously enough, a low load on the system causes communication problems. Therefore, these Powersafe functions should be disabled if problems occur. Real-time patch (Linux) To make sure that short send clocks (1 ms or less) are reliable, it is usually necessary to install a real-time patch on the Linux system. This depends on the performance and load of the respective platform. Recognizable by a large jitter of the \"Profinet_IOTask\" (in task monitoring). Increase of the priority of the network task which manages the PROFINET network adapter. Use the PLC shell to execute these commands (for details, see the runtime description): irq-list\nirq-set prio eth 0 Traffic scheduling (Linux) If you use the Profinet network adapter in parallel with other services which generate a high volume of data traffic (such as a large web visualization), then the Profinet real-time data may be displaced on the adapter. This can be prevented by traffic scheduling, in which the Profinet data is prioritized higher. Example: Linux.PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS is set in the *.cfg file of the runtime.

Here we are looking at the controller only. The same basically applies to the device. The most important fields in the diagnosis structure displayed here are as follows: Controller status : Current status of the controller; the individual values correspond to the enumeration Profinet.ControllerState : Specific conclusions about problem sources can often be drawn from these values, for example for license issues or doubled station names. The status value is also available in the PLC application: Received frames \/ Received RT frames : Under specific conditions, the controller status switches to \"Run\", but communication is still not possible. The values Received frames \/ Received RT frames can provide more information: Received frames shows the number of all Ethernet frames that were received over the Ethernet interface. Received RT frames shows the subset of the PROFINET RT frames. If both counters remain at 0 after starting the controller although the device is in a network, then this indicates basic problems with the runtime component SysEthernet . If only Received frames increments but not Received RT frames although PROFINET devices are in the network, then this indicates a problem with the runtime configuration (firewall, package filter, etc.). Invalid Cyclic Frames : When the counter increments, this indicates problems with the runtime component SysEthernet or the Ethernet driver. Received PROFINET frames are rejected as faulty. UDP\/Ethernet adapters are often the cause. Use the internal Ethernet adapters of the system. Send Errors : The counter shows the failed attempts at sending data via the Ethernet adapter. When the value is > 1, this indicates problems with the runtime component SysEthernet or the Ethernet driver. Recv Time \/ Send Time : The maximum value and the average value are displayed here for both sending and receiving of the Ethernet frame. The values indicate the performance for the link to the Ethernet adapter (runtime interface SysEthernet ). Very high values (> 500 us) indicate a system overload or an interruption of the real-time behavior. Under some circumstances, this leads to unstable communication (connection interruption with DHT error). Only very long send intervals (> 8 ms) may be possible. For example, typical values for CODESYS Control RTE with 10 slaves and a 1ms send interval are 20–30 us, for Linux \/ARM 200–300 us. " },

"body" : "The CODESYS PROFINET Controller and the CODESYS PROFINET Device are continuously checked against the currently valid versions of the PI Conformance Tests. However, a PROFINET product certification always and exclusively applies to the overall system. The overall system consists of the hardware platform and \"firmware\", which includes the operating system, the CODESYS runtime system, and PROFINET components. The data sheet for the PROFINET Controller and the CODESYS PROFINET Device lists the supported CODESYS runtime system versions. Therefore, the device manufacturer is responsible for some requirements for successful certification. These include the following: Performance \/ Network Load: The performance of the network components (hardware and protocol stacks) must fulfill some minimum requirements.  In special load tests, the robustness of the communication is tested in the event of targeted disruptions caused by generated network traffic (for example, with 5% of the supported bandwidth). There may be a maximum deviation of +-10% for the send clock of the I\/O data of maximum 4 ms. DCP Signal: To implement the DCP signal command, the device has to be able to visually signal its reception to the user. This is usually done by a 3-second flashing of an LED which is permanently installed on the device.  By default, the CODESYS PROFINET Stack triggers the \"Wink\" event on reception ( DEV_ILC_IDENTIFY ; see runtime system documentation) to which the manufacturer can register. The runtime system function SysTargetGetSerialNumber() should generate a unique serial number (16 characters). HW Tests: Checking the correct behavior of the network components against various Ethernet components. For details about certification, see: www.profibus.com\/products\/product-certification\/ . There you will find the officially valid documents of PI (for example, specifications for tests and test cases) or the \"Test Bundle\". " }
