"body" : "CODESYS Communication allows for the simple publication and linking of data in applications. Data is published via OPC UA. The Communication Manager feature provides two options for this: Using OPC UA Information Models These are supported generically. The contents of the information model are translated into the corresponding IEC data types and declarations. Using the IEC Symbol Set Configuration of the Communication Manager IEC symbols can be released quickly and easily without having to explicitly create an information model beforehand. The new Communication Manager feature provides the following advantages for the publishing of data: You can use your own information models for OPC UA. Method calls with information models are possible. You can define completely independent symbol sets. In the previous symbol configuration, it is possible to hide global variables depending on the symbol set, but the type configuration always has to be identical. Additional abstraction between application and information model In the Communication Manager , the names for the clients can be configured separately which allows for a clean separation. In contrast, in the previous symbol configuration, the IEC names of the symbols are also transported outwardly, which means that refactoring in the application can result in clients having to be adapted. Simplified rights management for the symbol sets For more information, see: IEC Symbol PublishingBetter workflow: The IEC symbol publication editor provides the precompile information of the application for configuration. This means that the variables and types available in the project are provided for the configuration of the symbols in the editor without the application having to be compiled without errors. Discrepancies between the editor and the project, which may result due to changes in the project, will be brought to your attention and you will be assisted in making corrections. Detailed output of the tag count for symbol sets The user can better understand which symbols are effectively released. User-friendly editors, for example filter options to improve clarity The data is received via data sources. The source can be either another CODESYS application or any OPC UA Server . You can download the CODESYS Communication from CODESYS Store International or CODESYS Store North America . There you will also find the data sheet for the product. " },

For the following instructions: To control the publication, you have also created a data source of type OPC UA in the project. See here: Establishing the Connection of a Data Source OPC UA Client to an OPC UA Server. In the following, you create the required symbol configuration for a symbol set in the editor of an object of type IEC Symbol Publishing : Click Add Object to add a Communication Manager below the application. Add an OPC UA Server below the communication manager. Add an IEC Symbol Publishing object below the OPC UA Server and rename the object (for example, \"webvisu\", or \"client xy\", depending on the intended use of the symbol set to be configured). Double-click the symbol publishing object to open the editor. Below Precompile Sets in the left part of the window, the variables and types which are currently supported in the project for publishing are listed. Select one or more variables or a POU containing variables and drag the selection to the right part of the window. The variable(s) are inserted into the table. Configure all desired variables in the table for export as symbols. If necessary, assign a different symbol name and set the access rights. When assigning the access rights, note the Use access rights defined in the user management option at the top of the editor. When this option is selected, the rights assigned in the user management of the controller for the symbol set are also considered in addition to the access rights set here in the editor. The stronger restriction is applied. If you have structured data types in the project, then on the Symbol Type Editor tab you can make a specific symbol configuration for different variants of the type: For example, on the Symbol Type Editor tab, drag a POU of type STRUCT to the table on the right side of the window. Click the button to open the Data type members of <STRUCT> dialog. Select the members of the <STRUCT> POU to be exported as symbols and configure accordingly. Close the dialog. Option: On the Symbol Type Editor tab, drag the same POU of type STRUCT to the table a second time and configure it with the corresponding name as a \"variant\" of the first one. In the project, change something in the declaration of the STRUCT type, for example, add another member. Then click Refresh in the symbol editor. An icon is displayed at the corresponding entry in the table. In the tooltip of the icon, you will be prompted to click the button to resynchronize between the editor and the project. Click the button. The Data type members of<STRUCT> dialog opens and by clicking the editor and project are synchronized again. The new member is added to the configuration table. When the symbol configuration is finished, log in to the controller and open the data source object created for OPC UA to check the symbols for publishing. On the Tab: Variables, you can see the symbol set(s) with the variables and types you have defined as symbols. " },

"body" : "For providing symbols to an OPC UA Server, we recommend using the Communication Manager with the new configuration editor ( IEC Symbol Set Configuration) for CODESYS 3.5 SP18 and higher. The symbol configuration described on this page is outdated and should no longer be used. Use the symbol configuration to prepare symbols with specific access rights for project variables. You can use these symbols to access the variables externally. When generating code, CODESYS also generates a symbol file (*.xml) which includes the description of the symbols. The symbol file is stored in the project directory. The name of the symbol file is composed as follows: <project name>.<device name>.<application name>.xml Example proj_xy.PLC1.application.xml You can also generate the symbol file with the Generate Code command. This is very useful when downloading to the PLC is not possible. The variables that you export as symbols can be bundled in the symbol configuration editor or defined in the variables declaration using the {attribute 'symbol'} pragma. Another option is using the element in the SFC editor, where you can define the implicitly generated element variables that should be exported to the symbol configuration. For more information, see: SFC Element Properties The name of the symbol is generated in the symbol configuration in the following syntax: <application name>.<POU name>.<variable name> . When accessing the variable, you always have to provide the complete symbol name in this syntax. Example MyApplication.PLC_PRG.a or MyApplication.SymFB.a As a rule, read-only access applies to symbols for input addresses and for variables that are mapped to input channels. Write access is possible for testing purposes in simulation mode only. The symbol file is downloaded together with the application to the PLC. Depending on the device description, this file can be generated as an additional (child) application. This application is then listed on the Applications tab of the device editor. Syntax: <application name>._Symbols The symbol application is regarded as a \"normal\" application with respect to the maximum number of applications on the PLC. If the controller has a user management, then you can assign different access rights to a symbol to the individual user groups (clients). To do this, place the same symbol in different symbol sets and allow the individual user groups (clients) either to access a symbol set or not. An on-site operator or an operating data record, for example, receives more information and access to the same symbols as remote maintenance. When attribute pragmas are used for POUs and variables, the behavior of these POUs and variables can change with respect to the symbol configuration. For more information, see: Attribute Pragmas – Effects on symbols " },

You can download changes to a symbol set definition to the controller in an online change. When the application is deleted on the controller, the symbol sets are also deleted. When building the application, you can create and save a symbol file in XML format for each symbol set. When symbol sets should be used with OPC UA, it is a requirement that a certificate has to be stored for OPC UA. For instructions, see the \"OPC UA Server\" chapter. As a requirement for creating symbol sets and for granting access rights on the controller, the user management has to be configured both for optional and for forced device user management: In the editor of the controller, open the Users and Groups tab and click the button. When the user management is still not enabled, first click Yes to acknowledge the prompt about enabling the user management. In the Add Device User dialog, specify a new user name and a password for a user of the Administrator group. Then confirm the password and click OK. In the Device User Logon dialog, specify the User name and Password for the . Then click OK . The user and groups are displayed on the Users and Groups tab. In the following section, you will see an example of steps for creating symbol sets and the assignment of rights on the controller: Requirements The application has a defined symbol configuration in the project. A user management is configured for the controller (see above). For the example here, there should be a user group that has the necessary rights for the servicing of the plant. By default, this type of user group, named \"Service\", is already created. The Enable symbol sets option is enabled in the settings of the symbol configuration. The connection to the controller is configured in the Communication Settings settings of the device editor. Click the button in the editor of the Symbol Configuration in order to create a new symbol set. In the Add New Symbol Set dialog, specify \"Startup\" as the name for the set. In the toolbar of the dialog, click the button ( Build ) in order to display all symbols which are available in the project. Select the users who should belong to the set. Save the project. Click Online → Login to connect the application to the controller. Click Yes to the prompt of whether or not the application should be downloaded to the device. In the editor of the symbol configuration, click the Configure Symbol Rights button. The Symbol Rights tab of the device editor opens. Click the ( Synchronization ) button to synchronize the display of the symbol sets with the device. In Symbol Sets , you see all sets that have currently been downloaded for the application (for this example, at least \"Startup\"). In Rights , a table shows the user groups that are created in the user management of the controller. In the example, we assume that the default groups Administrator and Service have been created. When a symbol set is selected on the left, you see on the right the access rights of the individual user groups to this symbol set ( access granted; access denied). The possible type of access is already defined for each symbol in the symbol configuration (read, write, execute). On the left, select the Startup symbol set and double-click the preset minus sign for \"Administrator\" as well as for \"Service\". The symbol changes into a plus sign. The \"Administrator\" and \"Service\" groups now have access to the symbols in the Startup symbol set. For more information, see: Handling of Device User Management and OPC UA Server. " },

"body" : "The OPC UA information models provide plant information according to the OPC UA standard. This plant data contains both data and metadata, such as data origin, data quality, and data cross-connections. OPC UA-based plants can therefore be connected and analyzed faster. In plant and mechanical construction, there are several sector-specific OPC UA information models. For example, the Companion Specification EUROMAP77 is an information model for plastics and rubber machinery. An information model consists of different objects that contain meta-information, runtime information, and user data, such as process variables. Requirements: A CODESYS project is open. A controller with integrated OPC UA Server functionality has been added to the project. Click Tools → OPC OPC UA Information Model Repository . The OPC UA Information Model dialog opens. The information models with the URI http:\/\/opcfoundation.org\/UA\/ and http:\/\/opcfoundation.org\/UA\/DI\/ are already installed by default. To install the OPC UA information model that you need in your project, select it and click Install . In the Select OPC UA Information Model dialog, select the information model file *NodeSet2.xml from the file directory and click Open . Now the selected OPC UA information model is displayed in the OPC UA Information Model Repository . Add a Communication Manager object to the application of your CODESYS project. Add an OPC UA Information Model ( ) object to the Communication Manager . In the Add OPC UA Information Model dialog, specify a name for the information model according to IEC 61131-3 and select the desired information model in the Information Model URI list box. The list box shows all OPC UA information models from the OPC UA information model repository. Then click Add . In the Devices view, the publishing object, for which you have specified a name in the previous step, is inserted and the selected Information Model below it. The publishing object is opened in the editor. In the next steps, select those objects and data types from the OPC UA information model which you want to use in your CODESYS application. To do this, first open the Information Model in the editor. The type declarations of the OPC UA information model are displayed on the left side. Add the OPC UA type declarations desired for your CODESYS application by dragging them from the left area to the right area. For all types with the Modelling Rule as Mandatory , a corresponding IEC member is generated for the application later when the IEC declarations are generated. For the Modelling Rule as Optional , in the right area you can activate an IEC member to be generated for this type as well. For OPC UA types with the modelling rule as Optional Placeholder , in the right area you can drag and drop another corresponding IEC type to insert it. Example: When you have mapped all desired OPC UA types to IEC, click the Generate IEC declarations button. The generated IEC members are visible, for example in the OPC_UA_Symbols Objects folder, and can be used in the application. These members are available in the Input Assistant for the implementation of the POUs in your application. When arrays are generated, in the declarations you need to define the upper limits for the arrays because this information is not included in the installed information model file *NodeSet2.xml . In the next steps, you configure the OPC UA types which should be published in an OPC UA Client. To do this, in the device view double-click the OPC UA publishing object. In the OPC UA publishing editor that just opened, you can generate new instances for the POUs which you have generated in the Information Model . Or you can use instances which you have already declared in your application in PRGs and GVLs. To create a new instance, click Generate New Instance . In the Create New Instance dialog, select the IEC Type from the list box and click OK . An instance of the selected IEC type is generated and inserted in the editor. You can double-click the automatically generated name inst_n to change it. To search for instances which have already been declared in the application, click Search for Mapped Instances . In the editor, in the Root Node list box, select the directory where the instances should be displayed on the OPC UA Client. The directories that can be selected depend on the OPC UA companion specification. To publish these instances on an OPC UA Client, click Online → Login . When the application has been successfully downloaded to the controller, start the application. Start the OPC UA Client. In the OPC UA Client, the instances are displayed which you have selected in the previous steps in the OPC UA publishing editor. " },

Example: OpcUA_NodeId These are data types from the OPC UA specification which require special handling in the PLC application. Only read access is supported. Inheritance Inheritance is allowed for all OPC UA types. For example, new types can also be derived from String and Int32 . Note: In the case of derivations of base types, the base type is used as the basis for the mapping. As a result, the derived OPC UA type is no longer available in IEC. BaseObjectType as data type See description If more than one specific object type is allowed for a variable in an information model and it is up to the user of the model to select the specific type, then simply BaseObjectType is specified as the type of the variable. Normally, CODESYS generates its own function block in this case and inserts any existing child elements there. However, the user may delete this function block and also use another object type in the declaration. The only restriction is that it has to be an object type from the same information model. VariableType See description In addition to a data type, a variable in OPC UA can also reference a VariableType by means of a HasTypeDefinition . This is often used to decorate a variable with additional metadata ( AnalogItemType , EngineeringUnits , etc.) Because a variable can only ever have exactly one type in IEC, a structure is generated which: Contains a variable named \"value \" for the actual value of the data type Contains a variable named \"properties\" which can be used to access the other metadata. For an OPC UA Client, this generated structure is invisible. As expected, it only sees the correct data type at the variable and the metadata as child elements. " },

Then the single access to the individual variables of the DUT instance is allowed in IEC. HasComponent Variables and objects are mapped in IEC as variables. Therefore, each HasComponent reference becomes an variable declaration in IEC. Methods also become methods of the function block in IEC. The user has to apply the modeling rules in the information model editor before the IEC POUs are generated. Optional members can be selected or deselected and concrete members can be generated for placeholders. HasProperty In OPC UA, properties have the character of additional meta-information for process data. They can be of static nature, for example engineering units. But they can also change when the server is running. In IEC, this reference is handled exactly like HasComponent . As a result, variables are also created for this at the function block. An unresolved issue is the handling of properties at variables in UA (by means of the detour of HasTypeDefinition and VariableType). In IEC, the variable of type INT would have to be structured once again and have children. Currently, properties at variables in OPC UA are ignored and cannot be reached from IEC.

"body" : "The CODESYS Symbolic data source type is available only together with a CODESYS device. However, then it is advantageous to use this type. Below a CODESYS HMI device, you can configure the data link either with the CODESYS Symbolic data source type or CODESYS ApplikationV3 data source type. We recommend that you select CODESYS ApplikationV3 as the data source type only when there are no resources for the symbol configuration available on the remote device. For example, this is the case with embedded or mini PLCs whose applications often do not contain a symbol configuration. The requirement for a connection setup is that symbols have been configured in the remote device and as a result a symbol file exists. The application in the remote device has a symbol configuration. Then the data link can be established via symbolic monitoring. In the case of symbolic monitoring, the symbol file on the remote device is read and the stored variable information is used for the data source variables and the data transfer. The advantage is that the application does not have to be updated in the local device when someone modifies the remote application without updating its symbol configuration. If the symbol file is also located on your development system (either a file or a symbol configuration object as part of your project), then the local symbol file can also be read. Then you can work offline during the development phase. During the development phase, you can create a variable list offline by means of local symbol configuration files. In this way, you can develop a local application offline based on the symbol information without a connection to a data source. As of CODESYS Communication 4.5.0.0 and programming system \/ runtime system V3.5 SP20, structured data types are transferred with their original type name instead of the previously used name GeneratedType_<number> . The following connection types are possible: CODESYS V2 The devices exist in the same network. The V2 runtime on the remote PLC provides a communication interface. CODESYS V2 (via gateway) The devices do not exist in the same network. They are connected via a V2 gateway. Note: For this connection, a CoDeSys V2.3 Gateway Server (V2 gateway) has to be installed on the development computer where CODESYS V3 is running. CODESYS V3 The devices exist in the same network. The V3 runtime on the remote PLC provides a communication interface. CODESYS V3 (via gateway) The devices do not exist in the same network. They are connected via a V3 gateway. " },

Because pumpA , pumpB , and pumpC are all of the same type on the OPC UA Server, it makes sense that they are also the same type locally. " },

Use this mapping type if your project depends on an existing data type can not or must not be changed. This is the case, for example, when the data type originates from a library and parts of this library, such as visualizations with this type, should be used together. Then it may be desirable to map the data from the data source to this existing type and overlap it. This mapping type is basically for similar use cases as \"Map Existing\". You can use this mapping type if a mapping to the existing data type is unsuitable. This may be necessary for the following reasons, for example: For library types with external calls which are not available on the data source controller. For library types which compile too many other unused function blocks. Example The project contains two function blocks ( Pump_I_Must_Use and Station_I_Must_Use ) which must be mapped to: A visualization which depends on such a data type is a common use case. Procedure In the Datasource editor , open the Type mapping tab. Click in the Remote type column and change the type so that it matches the type which you need. Then the recently created local types are overwritten and the VAR_IN_OUT variables used in the visualization elements work.

"body" : "At runtime, the remote data is saved to the data source variables. The data source variables and their mapping to the remote variables are displayed in the data source editor below of the Variablen tab. If the local and remote variables have the same names and the same data types, then the data is mapped 1:1. The variables and the data types are created automatically. That is the regular procedure. You can also map to existing variables. This is necessary, for example, if a visualization includes a data type in an interface. Then the same data must be passed to this visualization. In this case, the declared local variable and the remote variable have the same data type, for example from one library. Moreover, you can map a local variable with a conforming data type to a remote variable. The data type can be created on the Type Mappings tab. The specifically created variables and data types are declared in the DataSources_Objects folder. For each data source, a global variable list of the same name as the data source is declared there. Moreover, the data source variables usually have the identical or type-compliant data type as the remote control variable and they are declared as user-defined data types (DUT objects). Considering all data sources, multiple declaration of the same data types is avoided. Do not edit the data interface in the DataSources_Objects folder manually. It is created initially when adding a data source. Changes can be made later in the editor of the data source. For more information, see: Updating the Data InterfaceExample Library SnakeUtil The example demonstrates how variables of the data source are created. At this time, new variables are created, data is mapped to existing data types and their variables, and new data types are created with type-conforming mapping. The remote PLC uses POU instances from the SnakeUtil library and the HMI device displays these POU instances. This is why the HMI application requires a variable in the user interface that has a data type appropriate for a visualization template. As a result, the SnakeUtil library is linked integrated into the HMI application and the HMI variables instantiate the SnakeUtil.SnakeVisu visualization function block. The following library function blocks from the SnakeUtil library are used in the remote PLC: SnakeUtil.Snake function block: Equipped with a lot of logic and calling from external functions DUT SnakeUtil.PositionInfo : Two values (of the variables x and y) DUT: SnakeUtil.DrawingInfo : Image ID The SnakeUtil.SnakeVisu visualization function block with transfer parameter SnakeUtil.Snake displays the Snake function block. The following settings are entered in the editor of the Type Mappings tab: In the visualization, a frame is inserted with a reference to SnakeUtil.SnakeVisu . This expects to have the type SnakeUtil.Snake . The SnakeUtil.PositionInfo and SnakeUtil.DrawingInfo data types are mapped to existing data types ( symbol in the Create or map column). The data types are small and contain data only. The SnakeUtil.Snake function block is very complex and calls external functions that are not available in the HMI visualization. The function block with code is not required in the visualization. You need a less extensive but compatible and conforming type in the HMI visualization. Therefore, do not create the original data type directly. Instead, first modify the original data type and remove the unnecessary elements. In the Create or map column, then click the symbol to create the new Snake data type. " },

You can define the time interval. Moreover, you can define variables whose data is transferred in each update interval, and therefore they are always update. To update variables that are not used in the application code, you can implement an update programmatically with the help of interface functions from the data source manager. If data traffic between the remote and local device is too high, then the refresh rate is reduced automatically. This can lead to an incomplete transfer. Updating data programmatically The data source manager provides interface functions in the Datasources library. If a data source manager is integrated in the application code, then the global variable g_Datasources is instantiated automatically. This provides access to the interface functions. Then you can update individual variables that are not called in the active visualization.

The value TRUE blocks the processing until the access to the variable is possible; FALSE repeats access attempts without blocking. The return values ERR_OK and ERR_DS_MULTITASKING_LOCKED provide feedback about the access attempts. When synchronization is successful, the variable is activated by means of the UseData method. Then the data configuration is completed with the EndDataConfiguration method and the synchronization triggered again with the task DatasourceTask . The ReleaseData method is used in the same way for deactivating the variable again at the desired processing time. " },

NOTE: When a user management is active on the controller, a login with user name and password is required for a connection from the client to the OPC UA Server.

Add a Data Sources Manager object to the application. Add a Data Source OPC UA-Server to the Data Sources Manager . The Datasource dialog opens. In the Initialize Data Source dialog, configure the data source for communication in the following. With the option Read Connection Settings from IEC Variable option, you can dynamically configure the connection settings instead of defining them here in the dialog. For more information, see: Using a Dynamic Connection to an OPC UA ServerThe settings from this dialog are reflected accordingly on the Communication tab of the data source manager: For Where to find the server layout , define how the information about the existing variables and types should be detected. When you select the Browse Live Server option, the OPC UA Client connects to the OPC UA Server for this purpose and reads the information there. When you select From Information Model , the client reads the same information from an installed information model and does not require a running OPC UA Server to do this. For Server URL , specify the URL of the started OPC UA Server. Click the Show All Endpoints button to open the Available Endpoints dialog. Select an endpoint which defines an Encrypt & Sign message security mode and a corresponding security strategy. After the dialog is closed, these settings are transferred to the Security section of the Initialize Data Source dialog. Choose a suitable Client certificate to access the server for browsing purposes. If a certificate is not available for selection yet, then you can have one generated immediately. To do this, click the button to open the Generate self-signed certificate dialog. Define a password for your private key and a file name for the certificate. When you click OK , the certificate is generated and automatically entered into the certificate store. The *.cer and *.pfx certificate files are stored with the project file. As a result, you can \"give\" the certificate with the public key (*.cer) to the server so that it \"knows\" the certificate. You can also share the private key (*.pfx) to make the project usable on another machine (for browsing). Note that this certificate can be used only for browsing the server for variables and data types. An additional certificate is required for data exchange in online mode. Its creation is described below. Click Next . Now the client scans the OPC UA Server to find the variables and types of the OPC UA Server. The OPC UA Server has to be in online mode to do this. Now select one or more variables. These variables can be exchanged later via encrypted communication between the OPC UA Client and the OPC UA Server. For the variables, components are created in the Devices view, in the DataSources_Objects folder. The variables can be used in the application. Note: As long as no value has been read, the variables have their default value according to IEC. For more information, see: Default initialization values In the next steps, you create a certificate for the encrypted communication from the OPC UA Client to the OPC UA Server. Click View → Security Screen . Switch to the Devices tab. In the view on the left, select the controller. In the right view, all services of the controller are displayed which require a certificate. Select the service CmpOPCUAClient . Create a new certificate for the device. To do this, click the icon. The Certificate Settings dialog opens. Define the certificate parameters and click OK to close the dialog. The certificate is created on the controller. Click the button and save the certificate to the local file directory of the OPC UA Server, in the certs folder. Now when you restart the OPC UA Server, it will recognize the client certificate. The server sends its certificate to the client. In the following steps, this certificate will be made \"trusted\" to the client. To do this, in the Security Screen view, on the Devices tab, click the Certificates in Quarantine folder in the left area. The certificate is displayed in the right area. Drag this certificate to the Trusted Certificates folder. Now the server certificate is \"trusted\" by the client. Now when you connect to the controller and the application starts, the data source variables of the OPC UA Client can be exchanged with the OPC UA Server via the encrypted connection.

Note that you can populate the fields of the UserConfigurationV1 structure with values at any time. For example, this can be done when starting the controller, from a configuration file, or from a visualization dialog. However, the EndpointUrl setting always has to be defined. All other settings can be freely assigned. In this way, for example, it is possible to use a different security operating mode than in the usual editor. Furthermore, some settings, which are not available in the editor, can be configured on the OPC-UA connection. When all connection settings are configured, you can set the xValid parameter of the UserkonfigurationV1 to TRUE . In the implementation part of PLC_PRG : config.SubscriptionPublishingInterval := config.SamplingInterval := TIME#2S;\nconfig.xValid := TRUE; In the next cycle, the data source establishes the connection.

"body" : "The standard installation of CODESYS Communication includes an OPC UA Server. You can extend your project to include this by first selecting the Communication Manager object below the application and then below that adding the OPC UA Server object. You can use the OPC UA Server object to establish a connection via a client and then access the variable interface of the controller. The OPC UA Server communicates with connected OPC UA Clients via a separate TCP connection. For this reason, the security of these connections must be checked again separately. The OPC UA Server can now be safeguarded by using encrypted communication to the client and OPC UA user management. You will find the possible settings for this in the following sections: In runtime version 3.5 SP17 and higher, a device user management has to be set up by default for access to the CODESYS runtime systems. However, for the OPC UA Server it is possible to continue to allow anonymous access if this is explicitly permitted. This permission is granted in the Change Communication Policy dialog on the Communication Settings tab of the device editor. The CODESYS OPC UA server supports the following features: Browsing of data types and variables Standard read\/write services Notification for value changes: subscription and monitored item services Encrypted communication according to \"OPC UA standard (profile: Basic256SHA256)\" Imaging of the IEC application according to \"OPC UA Information Model for IEC 61131-3\" Supported profile: \"Micro Embedded Device Server Profile\" Number of sessions By default, monitored items and subscriptions are not restricted. The number depends on the performance of the respective platform. Sending of events according to the OPC UA standard Communication with a data source OPC UA Client For more information, see the following: Establishing the Connection of a Data Source OPC UA Client to an OPC UA ServerThe OPC UA Client UAExpert is cited many times in this chapter.

Insert a Visualization object below the Application . Download the project to the controller and start it. Alarms are used and generated normally. No special steps are required here. If you want to create events, then the following additional steps are required. Insert an AlarmClass object below the Alarm Configuration . Specify a name (example: Event ). The new alarm class opens in the editor. Select the acknowledgment method REP . Insert an Alarm Group object below the Alarm Configuration . Specify a name (example: ApplicationEvent ). The new alarm group opens in the editor.

A detailed description of this setting can be found below in the section Setting: Configure synchronization with IEC tasks. Note: Variable access which is synchronous with the IEC tasks can increase the jitter for all IEC applications on this device. Synchronized consistent access can interrupt the real-time capability.

Optimized layout : Recommend for new projects Calculates the output layout in optimized form detached from the internal compiler layout Does not generate any gaps for unpublished elements and strictly fulfills the requirements for memory alignment of the data types Requires compiler version 3.5.7.0 or higher. Compatibility layout : This setting is used for the compatibility of old projects. The data layout created for the client is matched as much as possible to the layout created internally by the compiler. Due to the configuration possibilities of the symbol configuration which have grown over time, problematic offsets can still result. Causes of offsets: Memory gaps due to internal pointers or references in function blocks and structure components that are not released for symbol configuration Memory gaps which occur differently in 32-bit and 64-bit systems depending on the data type, such as __XINT \/ __XWORD Fields which are at uneven addresses Some clients are not set up for this. Unintentional memory misalignment, which occurs when using the attributes 'pack_mode' or 'relative_offset' Use Empty Namespaces by Default (V2 Compatibility) : Required when using a CODESYS V2-compatible OPC server configuration : Behavior same as in CODESYS V2.3 Program variables are exported without an application name: ( Application.PLC_PRG.MyVar → PLC_PRG.MyVar ) Global variables are exported additionally without the GVL name. Enable Direct I\/O Access : This feature is potentially dangerous and not intended for operation in production . Enable only for error checking and tests, or when commissioning the machinery (for example, for checking cables connections). : In the symbol configuration, you can also use access to direct I\/O addresses that correspond to IEC syntax (for example, %IX0.0). Access to input addresses (I) is read-only*. Access to output addresses (Q) and memory addresses (M) can be read-write. * Information: In simulation mode, write access to symbols is also possible for input addresses. Because external clients for protocols such as OPC or OPC UA do not always support IEC syntax for direct addresses, access is also provided using an array syntax in the namespace __MIO of the implicit code. For example, you can also access __MIO.MIO_IX[2].x3 instead of %IX2.3. However, the symbols for array access are hidden in browsers because some clients cannot handle the large number of nodes (several thousand depending on the size of the I\/O ranges). Support Calls of Functions, FBs, Methods, and Programs : Note: Availability and editability of this option depend on the device. : The access rights execute can be set in the symbol table for symbols of POUs of type function, function block, method, or program.

You can use this to configure symbol sets for client-specific assignment of access rights to the controller. See \"Toolbar for symbol set configuration\" below. Tools Save XSD Scheme File : This command opens the standard dialog for saving a file in the file system. With this command, you can prepare the XSD format of the symbol file, for example for use in external programs. Symbol table Access Rights You can change the access rights for a symbol by clicking the symbol in the Access Rights column. Icons for access rights (in ascending order) : Read only : Write only : Read and write : Execute This permission allows for execute permission to functions, function blocks, methods, and programs. Requirements for the assignment: The device provides the Support calls of functions, FBs, methods, and programs and Support OPC UA features options. Both options are activated in the Settings . Note: In case the controller has a user management, you can use symbol sets to define client-specific access rights to the same symbols. Maximal Maximum access rights for this symbol Attribute If the access right was assigned by attribute, then a corresponding icon is displayed here. Type Alias data types are also displayed in CODESYS V3.5 SP6 and higher. Example: MY_INT : INT for a variable declared with the data type MY_INT (type INT ). Members You can add variables of a structured data type also by selecting a check box for symbol configuration in the Symbols column. This causes CODESYS to export all \"member\" variable symbols. However, in the Members column, you can click the button to select only specific structural components. Note: This selection applies to all instances of this data type for which symbols are exported. If a member of a structured type cannot be selected, then an asterisk ( ) is displayed in the check boxes of the members to indicate that all exportable members of that type are exported.

"body" : "For synchronously consistent access, the symbolic client waits in the runtime when processing a read or write request until a time is found when no IEC task is executed. When this gap is detected, restarting the IEC tasks is prevented until all values of the variable list have been copied. Then the IEC tasks are planned again as usual. Synchronized access can cause a delayed starting of IEC tasks, which is shown as increased jitter. As all applications in the runtime are managed by a common scheduler, this potential impairment of the real-time behavior affects all applications on the device. All applications of the device are affected, regardless of whether or not they include a symbol configuration or they have been downloaded to the controller from one or more CODESYS projects. Therefore, the runtime allows synchronized consist access only if this it allows all applications that are downloaded to the controller at the time of access. The setting is located in the editor of the symbol configuration of the Settings menu. In addition, the setting is also located in the context menu of the controller when you click the Properties command and then select the Options tab in the opened dialog. For applications without symbol configuration, the setting can only be found in the properties dialog. After changing the setting, all applications downloaded to the device by means of a download or online change have to be reloaded and all boot applications updated. In which cases is synchronized consistent access necessary? As a rule, there is no need for consistent values for displayed values because it is mostly irrelevant from which IEC task cycle the changed values originate. It is completely irrelevant for seldom changed values. Even when writing there are almost no hard consistency demands because typically the machine must be in a kind of standby mode (for example when writing recipes) in which there is no direct access to the values written as recipes. In contrast, consistent values are particularly necessary for database links to save production data. For clocked machines, however, these values must be synchronous with the production timing (one value set per produced product) and not consistent with reference to one or more IEC tasks. With reference to the machine clocking, the consistency must be already ensured by the IEC application. For this purpose, the values that arise during a production cycle are typically collected in a global variable list. At the end of the cycle, the symbolic client is notified by means of an additional variable ( BOOL or counter) that the machine cycle has ended and the values are valid. Now the client has the chance to archive the values from the production cycle. Depending on necessity, the successful reading can also be displayed in the opposite direction by means of a released variable, so that the production can also be halted in case the production data cannot be archived. Synchronized consistent access is not necessary and helpful for this use case because the synchronization is performed at the application level. In contrast, synchronized consistent access by symbolic clients is typically applied in the process industry with continuously running systems without production clocking when, for example when process values are written consistently and cyclically in a fixed time frame of 60s. This can be done either by synchronization on the application level similar to clocked machines (see above) or by synchronization of the synchronized consistent symbolic access. The advantage of the latter is that no logic has to be implemented in the IEC program and access is controlled entirely by the client. Due to the increased jitter, the synchronized consistent monitoring is not suitable for motion or real-time critical applications. For these reasons, synchronized consistent access should be released and used only if it is absolutely necessary. If a client uses synchronous consistent access released by this setting, then it has an effect on the client. Depending on the scheduler of the runtime, the response time can jitter more here for read\/write access because the system might still have to wait for an execution gap of the IEC tasks. Read and\/or write access can still fail when IEC tasks run for a long time (in the range of several 100 ms) or the CPU load is close to 100% for an extended period of time with one or more IEC tasks (in the range of several 100 ms). Therefore, the availability of the values also depends on the load of the controller by the IEC application. Moreover, the client can minimize the effects on itself and on the runtime if it observes the following in the definition of the variable lists to be read or written: Synchronized consistent access only to those variables that are absolutely and consistently required Separate variable lists for variables that have to be consistent and for variables that could be inconsistent Divide variable lists with several consistent variables into several smaller lists Select read intervals for cyclic reading of values as large as possible " },

This symbol list is then available for external access both as an XML file in the project directory and as a file that is invisible to the user on the target system. For example, the symbol list is then available for access by an OPC server. The variables which are identified by a symbol are downloaded to the controller, even if they are not explicitly configured or visible in the editor of the symbol configuration. In any case, however, a Symbol Configuration has to be created below the affected application in the device tree. Syntax: {attribute 'symbol' := ' <access possibilities> '} <access possibilities> : none , read , write , readwrite . The default value readwrite applies if no parameter is specified. Insert location: In order to affect only an individual variable, you need to place the pragma in the line before the variable declaration. In order to be effective for all variables in the declaration part of a program, you must place the pragma in the first line of the declaration editor. In this case, too, you can still set instructions for individual variables explicitly in the respective line. With the following configuration the variables A and B are exported with read and write permission. Variable D is exported with read permission. {attribute 'symbol' := 'readwrite'}\nPROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n A : INT;\n B : INT;\n {attribute 'symbol' := 'none'}\n C : INT;\n {attribute 'symbol' := 'read'}\n D : INT;\nEND_VAR For more information, see: Pragmas " },

"body" : "symbol_config_no_check_alignment Unaligned data only with unaligned memory access If the symbol configuration contains unaligned values or symbols for a device which does not support the required (unaligned) memory access, an error is set. The following message is displayed: The component <name> of the SymbolType <symbol type name> without memory alignment cannot be published . This prevents potentially faulty code from being downloaded to the controller, which could lead to an unpredictable crash of the controller. The {attribute 'symbol_config_no_check_alignment'} pragma prevents checking whether or not the alignment of a symbol matches the memory alignment of the controller. Variables marked in this way are always exported as symbols, even if the memory alignment does not match.
