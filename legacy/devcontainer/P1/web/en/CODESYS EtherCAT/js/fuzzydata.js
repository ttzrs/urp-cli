If the mode is not selected, then all configuration settings for the master and the slave(s) have to be done manually. Expert knowledge is required to do this. The auto-configuration mode option has to be switched off to configure slave-to-slave communication. Autoconfig master\/slaves : The main part of the master and slave configuration is done automatically, based on the device description file and implicit calculations. The dialog for the FMMU\/Sync settings is not available. Even if this option of the master is selected, an expert mode can be enabled explicitly for each individual slave, which allows for manual editing of the automatically generated process data configuration. EtherCAT NIC Settings Target address (MAC) MAC address of the device in the EtherCAT network that is to receive the telegrams. Options Broadcast : A Target address (MAC) does not have to be specified. Redundancy : Enabled when the bus is constructed in a ring topology and redundancy is to be supported. With this function, the EtherCAT network remains functional even in the case of a broken cable. When this function is enabled, the parameters have to be defined in the Redundancy EtherCAT NIC Settings area. Source address (MAC) MAC address of the controller (target system) or network name (name of the adapter or PLC (target system)) Network name Name or MAC of the network, depending on which of the following options is selected: Select network by MAC : The network is specified by the MAC ID. Then the project cannot be used on another device because each network adapter has a unique MAC ID. Select network by name : Network is identified by the network name and the project is device-independent. Scan Scans the network for the MAC IDs or names of the target devices that are currently available. Redundancy EtherCAT NIC Settings These settings are displayed only when the Redundancy option is selected. Here the parameters of the additional device are defined according to the description for EtherCAT NIC Settings . Distributed Clock Cycle time (µs) Time span after which a new data telegram is dispatched on the bus. When the Distributed Clock function is enabled in the slave, the master cycle time specified here is transferred to the slave clocks. As a result, a precise synchronization of the data exchange can be achieved. This is particularly important when spatially distributed processes require simultaneous actions. An example of a simultaneous action is applications in which multiple axes have to execute coordinated movements at the same time. A very precise, network-wide time base with a jitter of considerably less than 1 microsecond can be achieved in this way. Sync offset Parameter for setting the delay time between the DC time base of the EtherCAT Slave and the cycle start of the PLC. The default value is 20%. This time is active at the same time for all slaves with DC. An offset of 20% means that the timer interrupt in the EtherCAT Slave takes place 20% before the next IEC cycle. This means in the case of FrameAtTaskStart = FALSE when the EtherCAT data is sent at the end of the PLC cycle: The PLC cycle may require 80% of the bus cycle time minus the delay time in the runtime, and this without the master no longer placing the current process data on the bus in time (assuming that the EtherCAT Slave expects the new data exactly with the sync interrupt). FrameAtTaskStart = TRUE (default value when using CODESYS SoftMotion ): For the controller program, nearly 100% of the cycle is always available. Here the Sync offset determines only when the EtherCAT data of the master is exchanged to and from the slaves relative to the time base of the EtherCAT Slave. If DC is active at the corresponding slave, then the default settings come from the respective ESI file. The device manufacturer can define additional offsets here in the form of the Shift time for both Sync 0 and Sync 1 timer interrupts. When the expert setting is enabled at the slave, these times can be changed manually. The Shift time is entered into the register 0x990 as an additional start time. A positive value means that the start takes place later and therefore the sync interrupt is executed later. It must be prevented at all costs that the sync interrupt takes place near the time of the IEC cycle because otherwise no data can exist for one cycle and devices go into synchronization error. Both offsets from the master and the individual offset of each slave have to be considered for this. With the normal setting of 20% offset for the master and 0% for the slaves, the jitter of the IEC cycle and the delays of the transmission timing by the system can be a maximum of +80% and –20%. Sync window monitoring : Synchronization of the slaves can be monitored. Sync window Time for Sync window monitoring . When the synchronization of all slaves is within this time window, the variable xSyncInWindow ( IoDrvEthercat ) is set to TRUE , otherwise to FALSE . Options Use LRW instead of LWR\/LRD : Direct communication from slave to slave is possible. Combined read\/write commands (LRW) are used instead of separate read commands (LRD) and write commands (LWR). Messages per task : Read and write commands (the handling of the input and output messages) can be controlled by means of various tasks. Automatically restart slaves : The master immediately attempts to restart the slaves in the case of a communication breakdown. Mailbox Gateway This functionality enables communication from an external device configuration tool via the mailbox gateway to the EtherCAT devices. The wiring does not have to be changed. In general, all specified mailbox protocols (CoE, FoE, VoE, SoE) can be used. Enable The communication via a mailbox gateway is active and can be configured. IP address IP address for the UDP connection. The UDP port is set to 0x88a4. Options 0.0.0.0 Only a EtherCAT Master can use a mailbox gateway because the port is blocked by the \"Bind\" call. Specific IP address (example: 192.168.99.91) With a specific IP address, the mailbox gateways are bound to each network adapter. More than one master can use its own mailbox gateway. Master Settings These settings can be edited only when the Autoconfig master\/slaves option is deactivated. Otherwise this is done automatically and they are not visible here.

Address Fields can be edited only when the auto-configuration mode of the EtherCAT Master is disabled. AutoInc address Self-incrementing address (16-bit) that results from the position of the slave in the network. The address is used only during the system boot when the master assigns the EtherCAT addresses to its slaves. When the first message runs through all the slaves for this purpose, each slave increments its AutoInc address by 1. The slave with address 0 then gets the data. A possible input here is \"-8\", for example . EtherCAT address : Slave address which is automatically calculated by the master and finally assigned during startup. Although the address is independent of the position of the slave in the network, it can change if additional devices are added. If the address is accessed via a slave instance in the code, then a variable address is advantageous. : Fixed, editable slave address. It also remains unchanged when an additional device is added. The following slaves in the device tree continue to use the address. If the address is accessed directly, then a fixed address is advantageous. Additional Expert settings : The Startup Checking and Timeout groups are also displayed on the tab. For more information, see below . In the device editor, the tab Process Data tab is displayed. You can make configure advanced settings there. Hint: Expert settings are not required for standard applications. For standard applications, the auto configuration mode is completely sufficient and recommended. Optional At the start of the stack, the system checks whether optional devices are available. This option is available only when the Autoconfig master\/slaves option is enabled in the settings of the EtherCAT Master and the EtherCAT Slave supports this function. : If this option is disabled, then the system only checks whether optional devices exist when the stack is started. The identification is read and checked once. If necessary, a device exchange is detected and corrected. No new identification check is performed during operation. : The slave is defined as optional. The check whether optional devices exist is also performed during operation. If it is determined that a device does not exist in the bus system, then no error message is generated. If a device is not found, then it is disabled automatically and displayed in gray in the device tree. A corresponding message is displayed in the logger. Note: If you define a slave as \"optional\", then it has to have a unique identification. You can change this by means of the three possible settings in the Identification section. For example, enter an alias address in the Configured station alias (ADO 0x0012) field. Diagnosis This area is displayed only in online mode. Current State State of the slave Possible states: Init , Preoperational , Safe Operational , and Operational The state Operational indicates that the slave configuration has been correctly completed and that process data (inputs and outputs) are being accepted. Startup Checking Check vendor ID By default the vendor ID and product ID of the device are checked against the current configuration settings when the system boots up. If they do not agree, then the bus is stopped and no further actions are executed. This is done to prevent an incorrect configuration from being loaded onto the bus system. The following options are available to customize the check. Check product ID Check revision number : The revision number is checked during the system bootup according to your selection in the list box. Download expected slot configuration : For online verification of the configured and actual module configuration. If the configurations do not match, then the device still switches to \"Run\". In this case, an entry is made in the device logbook. Timeouts By default, no watchdog is defined for the following actions. However, a timeout (in milliseconds) can be specified here if necessary: SDO access Timeout (in milliseconds) for sending the SDO list at system boot I -> P Timeout (in milliseconds) for switching from Init mode to Preoperational mode P -> S \/ S -> O Timeout (in milliseconds) for switching from Preoperational mode to Safe Operational mode, or from Safe Operational mode to Operational mode. Watchdog Set multiplier The PDI watchdog and SM watchdog receive their impulses from the local terminal clock divided by the watchdog multiplier. Set PDI watchdog This watchdog triggers when there is no PDI communication with the EtherCAT Slave Controller for longer than the PDI (Process Data Interface) watchdog time which has been set and activated. Set SM watchdog This watchdog triggers when there is no EtherCAT process data communication with the terminal for longer than the SM (SyncManager) watchdog time that has been set and activated. Identification In this section, you set the device identification of the slave. As a result, you can make the address of the slave independent of its position in the bus. The following options are visible only when the Activate expert settings option or Optional option is selected. If you have identified the slave as Optional , then you need to assign a unique ID to it. Note: You can change the identification via the three possible settings here. For example, enter an alias address in the Configured station alias (ADO 0x0012) field. Disabled The identification of the slave is not checked. Configured station alias (ADO 0x0012) Address that is stored in the EEPROM of the device. Example value: 1001 You can change the value in the Scan Devices dialog or in online mode. For stock devices, you need to assign this number one time. This means that you need to connect the device one time to an EtherCAT Master and save the number. Write to EEPROM Visible in online mode only for Configured station alias . Writes the defined address for Value to the EEPROM of the slave. Explicit device identification (ADO 0x0134) The device identification is hard set on the hardware (for example, by DIP switches). It is displayed in Actual address . Data Word (2 Bytes) A 2-byte value for the identification is saved in the slave. Example: 16#12 Value Expected value for the check. If the actual value does not correspond to this setting, then an error is issued. ADO (hex) Initial value from the device description. You can change this value in the Data word option.

"body" : "All errors of the EtherCAT Master also exist in the IEC application. The function block instance for each EtherCAT Master has a property to read the last error as an enumeration. For more information, see: IoDrvEtherCAT.LastError and ETC_LASTERROR Problem Possible Solution EtherCAT Master with red triangle in device tree Logger message: Error: more than 100 packets lost, perhaps communication lost! check the cables ! No communication possible between PLC and first device More than 100 consecutive packets are not received. Possible causes: The network cable between the PLC and the first device is disconnected or unstable. The power supply of the first device is disconnected or unstable. The first device does not respond to EtherCAT packets. Possible solution: Check the cables and the link LED. Check the power supply to the devices. Exchange the EtherCAT device. Some devices may have a red triangle in the device tree. Logger message: Working counter for sync unit group x is wrong! Group is set to nonoperational! If you use sync unit groups and at least one device in the sync unit group does not work, then the entire group is displayed as faulty. Not all EtherCAT Slaves transmit the process data as expected. Input or output data may be missing. Possible causes: Some slaves no longer communicate. The network cable between the EtherCAT devices is disconnected or unstable. The power supply of the devices is disconnected or unstable. The devices after the first devices do not respond as expected. Possible solution: Check the cables and the link LED. Check the power supply to the devices. Exchange the EtherCAT device. Some devices may have a red triangle in the device tree. Logger message: Warning unexpected working counters: number of slaves has changed or is different to the configuration! One or more devices do not communicate as expected. The inputs are not transmitted or the outputs are not used. Possible causes: The EtherCAT device is no longer ready for use because synchronization has been lost or another error has occurred in the device (excessive temperature, excessive voltage). Possible solution: Check the status page of the slave and also the device diagnostic page (if available). Logger message: Distributed clock is always same value! Change in and out connector of slave When using \"Distributed Clock\", the time of the first EtherCAT device with \"Distributed Clock\" is used to synchronize the other devices and the PLC. This error message is displayed when the time value is always the same. Possible causes: The input and output connection of the EtherCAT devices is incorrect. Possible solution: Change the input and output connector of the first device with the \"Distributed Clock\" option enabled. EtherCAT Master with red triangle in device tree Logger message: Checking slaves: perhaps slave(s) missing, mismatch to configuration or no communication at all. Use scan for devices to check When the EtherCAT devices are started, the number of available devices is determined and the EEPROM of all devices is read. If no devices could be found, then this message is displayed. Possible causes: The network cable is not connected or the wrong EtherCAT adapter is configured. The power supply of the EtherCAT devices is switched off of disconnected. Possible solution: Check the cables and the link LED. Check the power supply to the devices. Check the configuration of the network adapter in CODESYS . Exchange the EtherCAT device. Logger message: SysEthernet: packet could not be sent, error code The PLC runtime system could not transfer an EtherCAT packet. Possible causes: The network cable is not connected or the wrong EtherCAT adapter is configured. The power supply for the EtherCAT devices is switched off or disconnected. Possible solution: Check the cables and the link LED. Check the power supply to the devices. Check the configuration of the network adapter in CODESYS . Exchange the EtherCAT device. Logger message: AL Status read from slave address… The device detects an error and returns various error causes. Possible causes: Error in the configuration or the input or output settings Error in distributed clock Possible solution: Check the logger message for possible causes and corrections. " },
