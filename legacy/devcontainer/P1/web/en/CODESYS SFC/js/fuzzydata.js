"body" : "Basic behavior of elements Active step An active step includes actions currently being executed. In online mode, CODESYS displays active steps in blue. Init Step In the first cycle after calling a POU in SFC, the initial step is automatically activated and the step action is executed. CODESYS executes IEC actions at least two times. The first time is when the step is activated, and the second time when the step is deactivated (but not until the next cycle). Alternative branches If the step before the branch is active, then CODESYS passes the first transition of each alternative branch line from left to right. The next step is activated in the first branch line where CODESYS finds a transition which yields TRUE . Parallel branches If the step before the branch (horizontal double line) is active and the transition before the branch yields TRUE , then CODESYS activates the first steps in every branch line. The branch lines are then processed at the same time. The step after the end of the branch (after the horizontal double line) is activated when all the last steps in the branch lines are active and the transition after the double line returns TRUE . Processing order Reset of IEC actions CODESYS resets the internal action control flags of the action qualifiers ( N , R , S , L , D , P , SD , DS , and SL ). These flags control an IEC action. However, flags are not reset when they are called within actions. Execute exit actions CODESYS verifies whether all steps fulfill the condition for executing the exit action for each step. The order of verification follows the layout in the SFC chart, from top to bottom and from left to right. CODESYS executes an exit action when the step is deactivated (after any entry and step actions have been executed in the preceding cycle and the condition for the subsequent step yields TRUE ). Execute entry actions CODESYS verifies whether all steps fulfill the condition for executing the entry action for each step. The order of verification follows the layout in the SFC chart, from top to bottom and from left to right. If the conditions are satisfied, then CODESYS executes the entry actions. CODESYS executes an entry action as soon as the transition of the preceding step has been processed and yields TRUE , thus indicating that the step has been activated. Time check \/ Execute step actions Execute IEC actions CODESYS executes the IEC actions in alphabetical order. This is done in two passes through the list of actions. In the first pass, CODESYS executes the IEC actions for each step which was deactivated in the preceding cycle. In the second pass, the IEC actions of all steps are executed which are active. Transition check \/ Activate next steps The transitions are evaluated. If a step is active in the current cycle and the subsequent transition yields TRUE and any defined minimum time of the step has elapsed, then the subsequent step is activated. Note the following when you execute actions: An action can be executed multiple times within the same cycle because you use the action in multiple SFC charts. Example: A sequential function chart contains two IEC actions A and B , both of which are programmed in SFC, and both of which call an IEC action C . In this case, C would be called two times. If you use the same IEC action at the same time in different levels of an SFC chart, then this can lead to unpredictable results when processing. For this reason, CODESYS issues a corresponding error message. This error message can be displayed, for example, when you are working with projects which have been created in an earlier version of the development system. Note: It is possible to use implicit variables to monitor the processing status of steps and actions and to control processing. " },

Before inserting branches parallel to multiple actions and transitions, you must highlight these actions and transitions in a multiple selection. You can also drag SFC elements from the Toolbox view to the chart. When you drag an element over the editor, CODESYS marks all possible insertion points with gray boxes.

Inserting a step without a transition or a transition without a step causes an error when compiling. You can modify this by double-clicking the name. For more information about working in the SFC editor, see also: Programming in SFCStep names have to be unique within the scope of the parent POU. Consider this especially when using actions that were also programmed in SFC. Note that you can convert a step into an initial step by clicking Init Step or by setting the respective property in the SFC Element Properties. All steps are defined by the step properties, which you can display and edit in the Properties view, depending on the set options. You have to add those actions to the step which are to be executed when the step is active. There are \"IEC actions\" and \"step actions\". For more information, see: ActionA transition must include the condition for the subsequent step to be active as soon as the value of the condition yields TRUE . Therefore, a transition condition must yield TRUE or FALSE . It can be defined in one of two ways: Inline condition (direct): You replace the default transition name with either the name of a Boolean variable, a Boolean address, a Boolean constant, or a statement with a Boolean result (example: (i<100) AND b ). You cannot specify programs, function blocks, or assignments here. \"Multi-use condition\" (separate transition or property object): You replace the default transition name with the name of a transition or property object ( , ). Click Project → Add Object to create these objects. This allows \"multiple use\" of transitions, for example \"condition_xy\" in the figures below. Like an \"inline condition\", the object can contain a Boolean variable, Boolean address, Boolean constant, or an statement with a Boolean result. In addition, it can also contain multiple statements with any code. It is the responsibility of the user to assign the desired expression to a transition variable if the transition contains multiple statements. Transitions which reference a transition or property object are marked with a small triangle in the upper right corner of the transition box. In contrast to CoDeSys V2.3 , now CODESYS handles a transition condition like a method call. The input is made according to the following syntax: <transition name>:=<transition condition> (Example: trans1:= a=100 ) or only <transition condition> (example: a=100 ) You will find an example ( condition_xy ) in the figure above.

"body" : "Action Symbol: An action includes one or more statements in one of the valid implementation languages. You can assign an action to a Step and Transition. Actions that you use in SFC steps have to be created as POUs in the project. Exception: In the case of IEC actions, which you add to a step as action association, you can also specify a Boolean variable instead of an action object. The value of these variables is switched between FALSE and TRUE each time the \"action\" is executed. You have to define unique step names within the scope of the \"parent\" POU. An action written in SFC must not contain a step with a name identical to the step to which the action is assigned. There are \"IEC actions\" and \"step actions\". Difference between IEC actions and step actions The main difference between step actions and IEC actions with a qualifier N is that an IEC action is always executed two times: when the step is activated and when the step is deactivated. See the following example: Example You have attached the Action_SFC1 action to the SFC1 step as a step action (left) and as an IEC action with qualifier N (right). Because two transitions are activated in each case, the time to reach the initial step again is two PLC cycles. This is true as long as the iCounter counter variable was initialized at 0 and then incremented in the Action_SFC1 action.  After the Init step is reactivated, iCounter returns a value of 1 in the example on the left. In the example on the right, a value of 2 is returned because the IEC action is executed a second time due to the deactivation of SFC1 . Another difference: Step actions can be \"pseudo-embedded\". In this case, they can be called only from the related step. If you copy this step, CODESYS creates new action objects automatically and copies the respective implementation code. You define whether or not a step action is \"embedded\", either when the first action is inserted into the step, or later in the Duplicate when copying element property. In general, this behavior can also be preset in the SFC options. Moreover, for IEC actions, a Boolean variable can be specified instead of an action object. This is not possible for step actions.

The copied step and new step call the same action. Duplicate implementation : The reference to the action objects which call the step are linked to this step. When copying the step element, new action objects are created for the new step, and the implementation is duplicated. Always ask : When inserting a step action, you are always prompted whether the actions of a step element should be duplicated when it is copied, or whether the reference to the existing action should be applied. Note: If a step already contains an embedded action, then new inserted actions of this step are also embedded. Likewise, new inserted actions are not embedded when the step already contains a non-embedded action. In these cases, you are no longer prompted for a duplication mode.

"body" : "Insert Branch Right Symbol: Function : The command inserts a branch to the right of the selected position. Call : SFC menu The type of inserted branch depends on the selected element. If the top element of the selected elements is a transition or an alternative branch, then CODESYS inserts an alternative branch. If the top element of the selected elements is a step, a macro, a jump, or a parallel branch, then CODESYS inserts a parallel branch with the jump marker Branch<x> , where x is an incremental number. You can edit the default name of the jump marker. You can define the jump marker as a jump destination. If a common element of an existing branch is currently selected (horizontal line), then CODESYS inserts the new branch line as a branch line on the far right. If an entire branch line of an existing branch is currently selected, then CODESYS inserts the new branch line directly to the right as a new branch line. Note: You can convert a branch into another type by means of the Alternative and Parallel commands. Example: Parallel branch The following image shows a new inserted parallel branch generated by the Insert Branch Right command while the Step11 step was selected. CODESYS automatically inserts a step ( Step2 in the example). Processing in online mode: If t2 yields TRUE, then CODESYS executes Step2 immediately after step11 and before t3 is passed. Therefore, different from alternative branches, CODESYS processes both branch lines. Example: Alternative branch The following image shows a new inserted alternative branch generated by the Insert Branch Right command while the t4 transition was selected. CODESYS automatically inserts a step ( Step32 in the example) and a preceding and subsequent transition ( t41, t42 ). Processing in online mode: If Step3 is active, then CODESYS passes the subsequent transitions ( t4, t41 ) from left to right. The first branch line of the main branch with the first transition yielding TRUE is passed. Therefore, only one branch line is processed as opposed to with a parallel branch. " },

You enter the action name in the right section. To do this, click in the box to get an editing frame. You have to have already created this action as a POU in the project. You can also edit the qualifier. A list of valid qualifiers is described in the \"Qualifiers for Actions in SFC\" chapter.

If you apply the pragma to the base class, then its actions are protected against overloading. Syntax : {attribute 'no_virtual_actions'} Insert location: Top line in the declaration part of the function block The function block POU_SFC is the base class for the derived function block POU_child . The derived class POU_child calls the sequence of the base class written in SFC with the special variable SUPER . The exemplary implementation of this sequence is limited to the initial step, followed by a single step with a linked step action ActiveAction . This step with a linked step action takes care of the configuration of the output variables. an_int := an_int+1; \/\/ Counting the action calls\ntest_act := 'father_action';\nMETH(); \/\/ Call of the method METH in order to set the string variable test_meth In the case of the derived class POU_child the step action is replaced by a special implementation of ActiveAction . Active Action differs from the original only by the assignment of the string 'child_action' in place of 'father_action' at the variable test_act . Likewise, the method METH , which assigns the string 'father_method' to the variable test_meth in the base class, is overwritten so that test_meth now gets the value 'child_method' .The main program PLC_PRG calls an instance of the function block POU_child , named Child . As expected, the value of the strings reflects the call of the action and method of the derived class: Now, however, you place the pragma {attribute 'no_virtual_actions'} in front of the base class: {attribute 'no_virtual_actions'}\n\nFUNCTION_BLOCK POU_SFC... This changes the behavior: While the implementation of the derived class is still used for the method METH , the call of the step action now results in a call of the action ActiveAction of the base class. Therefore test_act is now given the value 'father_action' : " },
