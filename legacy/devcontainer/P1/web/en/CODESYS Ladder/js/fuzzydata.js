"body" : "CODESYS Ladder is the modern \"successor\" of the CODESYS LD FBD (which is also still available). Objects which have been programmed in CODESYS LD FBD can be converted to CODESYS Ladder . The editor of the CODESYS Ladder is a network-based editor for the IEC programming language, Ladder Diagram (LD). In the implementation part, you program a \"circuit diagram\" in one or more network elements. To do this, you can insert the required elements from the toolbox or by means of menu commands, link them, and provide them with input and output variables and modifiers. Each network can be given with a title, a comment, and\/or a jump label. You can also \"comment out\" networks. Elements are inserted and replaced simply by dragging an element from the toolbox to one of the offered insertion positions. The insertion positions are indicated by the following icons while dragging the element over the implementation line: Square with a gray background inside an existing element symbol Rhombus on a connecting line Triangle pointing up or down for insertion above or below The currently possible position \"lights up\", the mouse pointer gets a plus sign , and the element is inserted when the mouse button is released. Currently selected areas in the editor are highlighted in red and outlined. Suitable commands for modifying (Edge Detection, Set\/Reset, EN\/ENO), deleting, refactoring, searching, and so on are each located in the context menu. In online mode , monitoring and debugging using breakpoints and the writing and forcing of values are possible. The display in the editor is defined in the CODESYS options in the Ladder editor category. This covers, for example, the display of comments, addresses, or whether networks are provided with line breaks. Programs which have been created in the CODESYS LD FBD editor can be read into the ladder editor and futher edited. " },

"body" : "Requirement: In your project, you have created a POU in the Ladder ( CODESYS Ladder ) implementation language. You have this POU open and ready to be edited in the ladder editor. The following instructions describe only individual actions when working in the editor. No specific program is created. If necessary, see also: Navigation in the Ladder EditorInserting, updating, repositioning, and modifying elements in a network Insert : In the toolbox ( ToolBox view) of the editor, select the Contact element, for example, and drag it to the network. Press and hold the mouse button. When you drag across the network, possible insertion positions are indicated by the following icons: Square with a gray background inside an existing element symbol Rhombus on a connecting line Triangle pointing up or down for insertion above or below You can insert the contact element when the mouse pointer gets a plus symbol ( ). Release the mouse button at such a position. The contact is inserted in the processing line of the network. Insert Block : Insert a Block element in the network. Replace the three question marks ??? in the element box with the name of the desired block from the project or a library. To do this, double-click the question marks and ideally use the Input Assistant by clicking the button. Update Block : If you call a function block, for example, from your project in the ladder, then you also need to update in the ladder diagram after making a change to the base FB. To do this, execute the Update Parameters command. Insert Input : Insert an Input element before the block. To assign variables, replace the three question marks ??? at the element with the variable name. If necessary, the standard Auto Declare dialog opens. Select, Reposition : Reposition elements in the network: Select an element so that it is highlighted in red. In the case of a block, the box inside the block symbol has to be displayed with a red background. Drag the element to another possible insertion position until the cursor symbol becomes a square and release the mouse button. Replace : To replace an existing element with another one, drag the new element onto the one you want to replace. When the element to be replaced itself lights up green as an insertion point, release the mouse button. Add new network : Drag the Network element to the implementation part. You will see rectangular insertion points in the left margin where the network numbering is displayed. The new network is inserted above the insertion point. Modify Provide the elements in the network with modifiers. For example, select the input pin of a block and open the context menu. For example, click the Negate command to negate an input, or one of the Set\/Reset or edge detection commands ( Edge Detection – Rising Edge, Edge Detection – Falling Edge). The input is marked with the corresponding symbol. Example: Negated input at the block, set coil Creating and editing branches To switch the processing order in networks V1.2.0.0 and higher, see: Processing order and \"normalization\"Unlike the LDFBD editor, there are no elements for Branches in the ladder editor of CODESYS Ladder . You create and edit branches exclusively by positioning or repositioning elements. Examples: Create the following network: Drag the second contact to the insertion position marked with a downward pointing arrow in front of the first contact. A parallel branch open to the end is created. Each branch contains a contact. To create a closed branch from the open branch (to program an OR construct), proceed as follows: In both branches, select after the contact element (multiselection). The selection is indicated by the small square with a red background on the line. Then click Close Parallel Branch . The two parallel branches open at the end become a closed branch. There are two ways to reopen the closed branch: You select one of the two branches and drag the selection box to that of the other branch. You select both branches and click Open Parallel Branch . Note: If you have closed branches of multiple parallel branches, then the Open Parallel Branch command will always open all branches. Commenting out a network Select a network so that it is completely displayed with a red background. In the context menu, click Outcommented . The network contents are displayed in gray and the texts in italics. The network is not included during processing. Adding a network title, network comment, or jump label You can add a network title (1), a network comment (2), and\/or a jump label (3) to a network. To do this, click in the first, second, or third line in the upper left corner of the network. A jump label is used as a target when inserting a Jump element. The display of the network title and network comment is defined in the Ladder editor (LD2) category of the CODESYS options. " },

"body" : "Monitoring and Detecting Errors In online mode, the editor provides value monitoring and supports the writing and forcing of current values. You can set breakpoints, and the color-coded representation of the connections allows for a kind of flow control. Monitoring: In online mode, the actual value of each variable is displayed in the editor for the variable. Constant variables get a green C symbol. The display of the values is defined in the CODESYS options in the Ladder editor (LD2) category. Writing and forcing of values: When a variable is currently forced, this is indicated directly before the forced value by the symbol. If a value has been prepared for writing or forcing, then this value is displayed directly after the actual value in angled brackets <value> . Examples Forced variable Prepared value Constant value Color-coded representation of connections: In the online view of a ladder diagram, the connecting lines are displayed in color: connections with the value TRUE are indicated by a thick blue line and connections with the value FALSE by a thick black line. In contrast, connections with an unknown or analog value are displayed normally as a thin black line. The value of the connections is not read from the monitored variables, but calculated in the programming system. This is not a genuine flow control. Example: Connecting lines and breakpoint positions Breakpoints: Breakpoints are basically possible at positions where the values of variables can change (instructions), where the program branches, or where another POU is called. In the editor, possible breakpoint positions are indicated by an empty gray circle. Set breakpoints are displayed as a solid red circle. See the figure above: \"Example: Connecting lines and breakpoint positions\" . Possible breakpoint positions: On a callable POU (function block, function, program, action, method). Not possible with operator blocks (example: ADD , DIV ) On assignments Before parallel branches At the end of the block at the position of the return to the calling block NOTE: CURRENTLY NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. In online mode, an empty network automatically opens here. It is indicated by RET in place of a network number. On EN input and ENO output of a block On the entire network Indicates only that a breakpoint is set in the network. No breakpoint can be set on the entire network. Breakpoints in methods: CODESYS automatically sets a breakpoint in all methods which can be called. Therefore, if a method managed by an interface is called, then breakpoints are set in all methods which occur in function blocks that implement this interface as well as in all derived function blocks that use the method. If a method is called by a pointer to a function block, then CODESYS sets the breakpoints in the method of the function block and in all derived function blocks that use the method. " },

In the following example, the processing order is: x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 The yellow triangle in the margin of the network indicates such a case. If you want to switch the network to the new processing order, then you can \"normalize\" the network by double-clicking the triangle. This action cannot be undone.

You can arrange multiple contacts both in series and in parallel. In the case of two parallel contacts, only one needs to get the value TRUE in order for ON to be passed on to the right. When contacts are connected in series, all of them have to get the value TRUE in order for ON to be passed on to the right by the last contact in the series. As a result, you can use LD to program electrical parallel and series connections. A negated contact ( ) passes the TRUE signal when the variable value is FALSE . You can use the Ladder → Negate command to enable or disable negation of an inserted contact. " },
