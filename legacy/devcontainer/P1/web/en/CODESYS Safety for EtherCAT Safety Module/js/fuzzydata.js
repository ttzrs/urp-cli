Setting the parameters of the logical I\/O modules Open the device editor of the EL1904 module and set the FSoE address (example: 2). This is the address which is also set on the device via DIP switches. Open the device editor of the EL2904 module and set the FSoE address (example: 3). This is the address which is also set on the device via DIP switches. Logical I\/Os – Settings The connection ID must be parameterized in such a way that every logical I\/O module has its own unique address. This makes sure that the safe I\/O module can detect errors caused by the incorrect forwarding of a FSoE telegram. The connection ID is therefore checked in the safe IO module. The uniqueness is not checked by CODESYS . Defining the I\/O mapping of the logical devices Open the I\/O Mapping tab. Assign variables to the individual channels of the module. EL1904 logical I\/O mapping EL2904 logical I\/Os – I\/O mapping Programming a POU (program) Click Project → Add Object → POU ( EtherCAT Safety ). The POU has been added.

In case there are multiple EtherCAT Safety Modules, you need to manually add the matching logical I\/O. You need to select this logical I\/O in the I\/O mapping of the corresponding field device. The logical I\/O contains all safety parameters of the module, so that all safety-relevant information can be found under the safety application. See: Logical I\/O of a Safe Physical Device Logical I\/Os of global variables These objects can be used to exchange additional data between the EtherCAT Safety Module and the standard controller. To do this, you define global variables (logical exchange GVL) in the standard project and then connect these to the corresponding logical I\/O on the EtherCAT Safety Module ( Logical exchange devices ). See: Logical I\/O for Exchange of Data with the Main PLC (Standard Controller) The logical I\/Os of the safety application are linked with physical devices or with the Logical Exchange GVL (special object on standard side) of the standard application. This means that there is precisely one logical I\/O in the safety application for each physical device whose input\/output signals are processed in the safety application. Likewise, precisely one logical I\/O exists under the safety application for each GVL for the logical exchange of the standard controller. You can edit the fail-safe parameters of a device, whose inputs\/outputs are processed in the safety application, only in the corresponding logical I\/O in the safety application. For a better overview, you can add folders to the project tree under Logical I\/Os in order to group the logical I\/Os. By default, the logical I\/Os are automatically synchronized with the assigned device objects in the device tree. As a result, the logical I\/Os are inserted, renamed, or deleted when the associated fieldbus device is inserted, renamed, or deleted. You can use the Disable Logical I\/O Synchronization command to switch off this synchronization. The command is available in the context menu of the Logical I\/Os object in the device tree. " },

Note the following: If you change the name of a logical I\/O, then the name of the physical device or the logical exchange GVL will be automatically updated. You do not need to reassign these objects to the logical I\/O. The name of the Safety application object must be unique throughout the project and the name of the logical I\/O object must be unique within the safety application in order to be able to map the logical I\/O object uniquely to the field device or to the logical exchange GVL. If you rename or move a field device in the device tree or a logical exchange GVL in the main application (except for \"default assignment\"), then this does not change the assignment to the logical I\/O in any way. This is because the safety application is automatically modified: The assigned logical I\/O is renamed in the same way as the field device. If you delete a field device in the device tree or delete the logical exchange GVL in the standard application, then the result will be that the assigned logical I\/O will no longer be mapped to anything. If you delete a logical I\/O object, then the result will be that no more fail-safe settings are mapped to the field device. The variables in the safe exchange GVL (Safety variables) are also no longer connected. If another logical I\/O object is given the old name of a renamed or deleted logical I\/O object, then its settings are mapped to the assigned field device from now on. The variable values for Logical Exchange GVL are linked. The assignment is thus indirectly changed.

EtherCAT terminals from the fields of analog input, position measurement (angle\/distance), or communication (4 to 20 mA, incremental encoder, IO-Link, etc.) are extended by the TwinSAFE-SC function. With TwinSAFE-SC technology it is possible to achieve a safety level equivalent to the requirements of PL d\/Cat. 3 according to EN ISO 13849-1 (SIL2 according to En 62061). The input data of an SC module are nonsafe analog values. In order to use them in a safety function, the ESM application must analyze them, check their plausibility, and subject them to “voting”. This is done by certified function blocks such as FB_SCALING , FB_COMPARE , FB_LIMIT , etc. For safety reasons, at least one of the data sources must be a TwinSAFE-SC terminal when this is done. The other data can originate from other standard bus terminals, drive controls, or measuring transducers. As a result, all process data in the system can be made accessible to safety technology. CODESYS Safety for EtherCAT Safety Module supports the following modules EL3124-0090: 4-channel analog input (16 bit), differential inputs 4...20 mA EL3174-0090: 4-channel analog input (16 bit), individually parameterizable -10\/0…+10 V, or -20\/0\/+4…+20 mA EL3214-0090: 4-channel analog interface (16 bit) for 4 resistance sensors (3-wire technology) EL3314-0090: 4-channel analog interface (16 bit) for 4 thermocouples (2-wire technology with wire break detection) EL3356-0090: 1-channel analog interface (24 bit) for resistor bridge or load cell (4- or 6-wire technology) EL5001-0090: 1-channel analog interface (up to 32 bit) for SSI encoder EL5021-0090: 1-channel analog interface (32 bit) for SinCos encoder, 1 Vss EL5032-0090: 2-channel analog interface (up to 32 bit) for 2 EnDat 2.2 interfaces EL5101-0090: 1-channel analog interface (32\/16 bit) for incremental encoders with differential inputs to RS422 EL5151-0090: 1-channel analog interface (32 bit) for incremental encoder 24V DC The device descriptions of the supported modules are included in the package. These terminals provide analog input signals for the safety controller via a safeguarded TSC connection. They also have standard I\/O channels which you can use in the standard application. In the device tree, the terminal is represented as an EtherCAT Module ( EtherCAT Safety SC Module) with the EtherCAT settings and standard I\/O channels, and as a submodule for the TSC connection to the safety controller. For a complete description of the terminals with technical data and information on standard I\/O channels and configuration, see the corresponding device documentation. For application examples with TwinSAFE-SC terminals, see the TwinSAFE application manual from Beckhoff . Commissioning of EtherCAT Safety SC Modules Matching configurations must be set on the Safety and standard pages. In order for the data to be transferred, the TSC address and the Connection mode must be set to the same values in the logical I\/Os and in the SC Module. The settings of the module can be changed on the CoE Online tab. Setting the parameters of the logical I\/Os In the editor, open the logical I\/Os of the SC Module . Switch to the Safe configuration tab. Change the values TSC address and Connection mode values. Setting the parameters of the EtherCAT Safety Module Log in to the controller. In the editor, open the SC Module. Switch to the General tab. Select the Expert settings option. The CoE Online tab is displayed. Switch to the CoE Online tab.

"body" : "The FB_DECOUPLER function block is used to decouple signals from a TwinSAFE connection. The function block has 8 inputs and 8 outputs, whereby the inputs are looped through to the outputs one-to-one. The corresponding output must also be linked as soon as one of the inputs of the function block is used. This also applies in the reverse direction. Because a TwinSAFE connection is always assigned to a POU ( TwinSAFE group), the DECOUPLER function block can be used to distribute the signals of a TwinSAFE connection to multiple POUs ( TwinSAFE groups) and therefore decouple them. The function block can be used within an existing POU ( TwinSAFE group) to distribute the signals. The function block has to be used in a separate POU ( TwinSAFE group) if the signals should also be decoupled, because all used outputs of a POU ( TwinSAFE group) are switched off in the event of a communication error in the connection. The input signals of a TwinSAFE connection can now be linked to the inputs of the FB_DECOUPLER function block. The outputs can then be distributed to various POUs ( TwinSAFE groups). It works exactly the same way in the other direction. The outputs of a TwinSAFE connection are linked to the outputs of the FB_DECOUPLER function block, and the inputs of the FB_DECOUPLER function block can in turn come from different POUs ( TwinSAFE groups).

The Restart input of the FB can be activated (active or manual restart) by linking the input. An open bRestart input will create a compiler error.

In order to quit the safe state of the outputs, a FALSE–TRUE–FALSE signal sequence must be recognized at the Restart input in the case of active restart. In the case of non-active restart, the safe state is quit as soon as the bMonIn input or the bSecure input no longer request the safe state.

Furthermore, it is possible to use tMaxMutingTime to monitor the maximum duration of the muting process. The muting process starts with a TRUE signal of the first muting input and ends with the FALSE signal of the last muting input.

"body" : "The FB_CAMMONITOR function block is used to implement an electronic cam group. In addition to excentric mode, pendulum mode is also supported. Excentric mode: Only one direction of rotation is permitted in excentric mode. A check is performed to make sure that the position stops after one cycle at the latest after the upper reversal point (TDC: Top Dead Center ) plus maximum overrun ( OverrunMax ). OverrunTDC outputs the current overrun or the current position after TDC. The lower reversal point (BDC: Bottom Dead Center ) is specified with a lower and upper limit. After the BDC is exceeded, the press is in upward movement. This information is output at the bUpwardsMove output. If the press comes to a standstill without having reached or exceeded TDC again or if the direction of rotation is reversed, then the bCamMonOK output is immediately set to FALSE . After standstill is reached, a new cycle is permitted only after a falling edge is detected at the bReset input. The bBackwardsMove input is used to notify the function block that a backward movement of the press is permitted. This is permitted only if the position is between TDC1UpperLimit and BDCLowerLimit . The backward movement ends when TDC1UpperLimit is reached. In excentric mode, an upward cam can be connected to the bUpwardCAM input and an overrun cam can be connected to the bOverrunCAM input. If the bUpwardCAM input is active, then a check is performed to verify that the upward cam is set after BDC and reset again at 0°. If the bOverrunCAM input is active, then a check is performed to make sure that the overrun cam is set after TDC1LowerLimit and remains set while the press is in standstill. The overrun cam may be reset only after the next cycle is started. A backward movement of the press is permitted only if the bUpwardCAM and bOverrunCAM inputs are FALSE . The backward movement ends when the bOverrunCAM input becomes TRUE . Pendulum mode: Both directions of rotation are permitted in pendulum mode. Two upper reversal points (TDC: Top Dead Center ) are specified here. Because the curve with which the press is supposed to be driven can or must be modified for each product, the maximum range of the pendulum stroke is set for the limits of both TDCs. A check is performed to make sure that TDC1 and TDC2 are never exceeded. If this happens anyway, then the bCamMonOK output is set to FALSE . At the start of the cycle (falling edge at the bReset input), the press may start with any movement (pulsating, reverse, etc.) until the BDC is reached. After that, only the upward movement is permitted. The upward movement is output as a signal at the bUpwardsMove output. The lower reversal point (BDC: Bottom Dead Center ) is specified with a lower and upper limit. A restart is enabled via the bReset input. If the press is moving in the downward direction without a falling edge being detected at the bReset input, then it is stopped immediately by setting the bCamMonOK output to FALSE . The optional bUpwardCAM and bOverrunCAM inputs for connecting an upward cam and an overrun cam are not supported in pendulum mode. If they are active by mistake, then an error is set. FB_CAMMONITOR The FB_CAMMONITOR provides the user with a safe evaluation module which can safely output the cams ( bTDC , bBDC , and bUpwardsMove ) according to the set fixed values and depending on the current position. Function block output: bUpwardsMove The bUpwardsMove output provides the user with the information that the press is in upward motion after passing BDC. This signal can be used for muting light curtains, for example, or transferring control commands to the press. Position detection of the press Position detection must be implemented according to the required SIL or performance level. The user or machine manufacturer must prove that this condition has been fulfilled. The position value must be verified reliably, for example from several analog values or it must be made available to the function block in another safe way. The first can be implemented, for example, by means of the COMPARE function block. In addition, the bPressStarted input can be used to generate an expectation. In this case, the demand of a movement is communicated to the function block. Then the function block monitors that a change of position also occurs within the set parameters. Excentric mode \/ pendulum mode For excentric mode, the bExcentricMode input is set and the TDC2UpperLimit and TDC2LowerLimit inputs must be inactive or 0. The bPendulumMode input is set for pendulum mode and the TDC2UpperLimit and TDC2LowerLimit inputs must be active and not equal to 0.

Online deactivation Safety POU Name of the POU in the device tree Activation A deactivated group is permanently activated. After activating the group, the associated POU is stopped. To start it, its RUN signal must be set next from 0 to 1. Permanent deactivation The group is permanently deactivated. The substitute values for the outputs of the corresponding POU are set. See: Displaying Substitute Values after DeactivationTemporary deactivation The group is deactivated one time until the next time the EtherCAT Safety Module is switched on and is then automatically reactivated. During deactivation, the substitute values for the outputs of the POU are set. Passivation Passivation : A group with exactly one FSoE Module is deactivated when the connected device has been disconnected from the installation. After deactivation by online command, the connection defined in the group must report a COM error within the Timeout Passivation time (default value 10 seconds). If the device is still present after the Timeout Passivation so that no COM error is reported, then a group error is set and a corresponding diagnostic message is generated. Timeout Passivation Timeout OK After confirming the dialog, a login dialog opens. The user need to have the necessary permissions to execute this command. Current deactivation status of the group in the safety module Selectable as new deactivation status Selected new deactivation status. Becomes active after confirmation with OK and successfully logging in. Deactivation method not enabled for this group. (Activation is always possible.) The status changes from active to inactive immediately after the command is executed. The status changes from inactive to active only after a positive edge of the signal for RUN\/STOP . The status of the POU (active \/ inactive) is displayed in the device tree behind the object name. " },
