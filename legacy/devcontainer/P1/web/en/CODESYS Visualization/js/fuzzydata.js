Possible display variants include CODESYS WebVisu , CODESYS TargetVisu , and CODESYS HMI . In the development system itself, there is an \"integrated display\". Visualization editor In the graphic editor, you design your user interface from visualization elements. The visualization elements are provided from libraries in the Visualization ToolBox view. You drag an element to the editor area and adapt it in its Properties view. Referenceable visualizations A visualization can be referenced in other visualizations. This allows for the creation of user interfaces with a complex structure. To do this, CODESYS Visualization also provides predefined visualizations, for example for dialogs. Simple design change A simple change in the look and feel of a visualization is possible in one location by creating another visualization style. Multi-language capability You can use text lists to conveniently provide visualization texts in multiple languages. You can configure a user input element for switching to another language in online mode. User Management You can set up a visualization-specific user management for access control up to the level of the single element. Other useful features Function block instances of visualizations, array access from the visualization, real-time data logging, extendability of the pool of visualization elements, provision of graphical objects from symbol libraries, calls of PLC functions from the visualization, reusability of visualizations by depositing them in libraries. Overview of the objects in CODESYS Development System which are relevant for the visualization Visualization Object below an application in the device tree or in the POU pool with the programmable visualization screen A visualization can reference other visualizations so that multiple visualization screens become one user interface with any number of pages at runtime. Visualization editor and additional views In this IEC 61131-3-compliant editor, you use the visualization elements to create the desired graphical user interfaces, panels, dialogs, etc. The editor is made up of the following components: Graphical editor to arrange the elements Interface editor : To parameterize the visualization Keyboard Configuration : Configurator for keyboard inputs for online operation Element list : Overview of all used visualization elements and editor for the position of the elements on the Z-axis The following views are also available: Visualization Toolbox: Provides the available visualization elements Properties: Displays the element properties of the element currently selected in the editor Visualization element Finished element from one of the visualization libraries The elements from the libraries are provided for you in the Visualization Toolbox. Visualization Profile Defines which library is integrated with which version Each project that includes a visualization is based on this kind of profile in the project settings. Visualization style Determines the \"look & feel\" of the elements The style is set application-wide in the Visualization Manager. Ready-to-use styles are provided and you can also create your own. Visualization Manager Configures features such as user management, style, language, input type, etc. for all visualizations of the parent application. The Visualization Manager object is located below the application in the device tree. Display variant A visualization can be displayed in online mode in the following variants, which are created as objects below the Visualization Manager: CODESYS TargetVisu Target visualization and remote target visualization (Remote TargetVisu) on PLC devices CODESYS WebVisu Web visualization via a web browser CODESYS HMI HMI visualization on devices without an I\/O connection Visualization integrated in the development system Visualization library Collection of visualization elements that are provided in the Visualization Toolbox view Symbol library Collection of images and graphics that you can use in visualizations. When you insert a visualization object, you can choose which of the installed system libraries should be available in the project. Visualization Element Repository Repository to manage the visualization profiles and the visualization element libraries Visualization Style Repository Repository to manage visualization styles VISU_TASK Task which is automatically inserted as an object in the task configuration of an application Requirement: At least one object of a CODESYS WebVisu or CODESYS TargetVisu is configured below the Visualization Manager.

"body" : "Visualization integrated in the CODESYS Development System (\"diagnosis visualization\"): The integrated visualization in the development system is ideal for application tests, service or diagnostic purposes, and for commissioning a plant. When a device is connected to the controller, the visualization editor switches and animates the displayed elements. This variant is included in the free CODESYS Development System and can always be used independently of the controller being used. CODESYS WebVisu : This variant is a web-based representation of the user interface in a standard browser (PCs, tablets, smartphones). This allows for remote access, remote monitoring, as well as service and diagnostics of a plant over the Internet. A standard web browser communicates via JavaScript (optional with SSL encryption) with the web server in the controller and displays the visualization using HTML5. This technology is supported by almost all browsers and is therefore available on iOS and Android terminals. CODESYS TargetVisu : This variant is platform-independent and runs on control systems with an integrated display. The logic application and the user interface run on the same device. The user interface is displayed directly on the controller. This variant is suitable for operating and monitoring machines and plants. An optional extension of the runtime system is required to use CODESYS TargetVisu . CODESYS HMI : This variant is used for the PC-based visualization or for the display on dedicated display devices. This allows access to the process data of multiple controllers via the same user interface. User interfaces created with CODESYS are displayed on a remote display device. This eliminates the computational load on the controller. Communication with the controller takes place via the data source manager. This variant is ideal for operating and monitoring the machine on site, whereby the values of multiple controllers can also be displayed in one visualization. The display is on one or more operator panels without control functionality and I\/O control. In addition to Windows PCs, operating devices with other operating system platforms can also be used.

The current software metrics are displayed there quantitatively. The metrics of the CODESYS Visualization add-on are also described here. Software metrics Number of visualization tags Value of the metric in number of visualization tags The number of visualization tags is the sum of the tags across all applications. The number of tags of an application is the sum of the tags across all visualization objects. The number of IEC variables and the number of visualization elements are added together for each visualization object. The visualization element also takes into account the type, which is weighted with a certain number of tags. The following table shows what is counted with how many tags. Tags in Visualization Number of Tags Variable For a scalar variable ( INT , WORD , REAL , STRING ), one tag is counted. In the case of an array, each index is counted. In the case of structures. each variable in the structure is counted. A variable is counted only one time, even if it is used frequently in different visualizations. Local visualization variables and variables in the hotkey configuration are not counted. Trend , Trace , Histogram , Cartesian XY Chart For each curve, 100 tags are counted. Table For each cell, 1 tag is counted. All columns and only visible rows are taken into consideration. (number of tags = number of columns x visible cells) The cells of a template column are counted two times. ( Use template option). Combo Box, Array For the Variable and for Data array properties, 1 tag is counted. In addition, one tag is counted for each column in the array. Alarm Table , Alarm Banner One tag is counted for each cell. All columns and only visible rows are taken into consideration. Frame Frames are typically used with an interface. If a frame is used with different instances, then the variables of the instances which are used by the frame are counted. Constants are counted like variables when they are passed to interface variables. Dialogs All dialogs which are opened by an input action are counted like a frame reference. System dialogs are counted with the following number of tags: Number field: 5 Keyboard: 5 Text input with limitation: 5 Login: 5 Password change: 5 Configuration change: 20 Native controls All scalar variables are counted. HTML5 controls All scalar variables are counted. Configured constants are counted like variables (colors, fonts, ...) If the type of the variable is ARRAY oder STRUCT , then the number of tags is calculated depending on the element size. A cell size is defined with a width of 50 pixels and a height of 30 pixels. This can typically be used to display an INT variable. The number of tags is calculated using the following formula (width a and height b in pixels). t = a 50 p x ⋅ b 30 p x t=\\frac{a}{50px}\\cdot\\frac{b}{30px} " },

"body" : "Creating visualization objects in the project For each visualization, you insert a Visualization object into your project like any other object. This also applies to visualizations that should be used later only within other visualizations. You can insert the new visualization object directly below an application, or below the root node of the Devices view (for availability throughout the entire project). The required base libraries and other objects, such as the Visualization Manager, are inserted automatically. When you insert the visualization object below an application, the subordinate objects for the display variants supported by the device are also displayed. Every visualization object can be edited separately in the visualization editor. The following steps describe a simply example for creating an object for an application-specific visualization. Open a project with an application. Select the application in the device tree. In the context menu, click Add Object → Visualization . The Add Visualization dialog opens. There is at least the standard entry VisuSymbols Vx.x.x. (System) , possibly also other symbol libraries if they have been installed. Accept the default name Visualization for the visualization. Select the VisuSymbols option. The visualization symbols (graphics objects) which hare contained in the library are now available in your visualization project. Click Add to close the dialog. In the device tree, the Visualization Manager and Visualization objects are inserted below the application. Depending on the device in use, the TargetVisu and\/or WebVisu objects are also created below the Visualization Manager. If a TargetVisu object or WebVisu object is created, then a VISU_TASK object is also created below the task configuration with an implicit program call. The required visualization libraries are added automatically in the Library Manager of the application. The visualization editor opens with the Visualization editor view and the Visualization ToolBox and Properties views. In the Visualization ToolBox view, there is a Symbols button for viewing the symbols from the library VisuSymbols.library . In the visualization editor, create the desired visualization. Example of a device tree with two inserted visualizations: You can create a user interface from multiple visualization objects and link their pages using the Frame or Tabs structure elements. The Frame structure element references a visualization object whose images then appear as one page of a versatile user interface. The Tabs structure element can display multiple visualizations. You can display dialogs to request information from the visualization user in your user interface. To output information, you can display the message view. You design dialogs and messages as a special visualization object (type: Dialog ) whose image appears when the visualization user performs a certain input action. Usually a dialog opens after clicking a button. For creating an application-dependent visualization, insert the visualization object directly below the root node of the device tree. This corresponds to insertion in the POUs view. In this case, a Visualization Manager is not created with objects for the display variants. " },

It is interesting to note that depending on where the generated variables are inserted, the behavior of the adapted elements varies. Create a visualization as usual. This is typically used as a template so that it can be reused by superordinate visualizations as often as desired. Visualization: Template Make sure that the automatic generation of variables is enabled. In the navigator, open the context menu of the visualization and select the Properties command. The dialog opens. Click the Visualization tab and select the Use visualization and container size properties option if necessary. Add elements to your visualization and position them within the visualization area. Note: An element which has the Absolute movement or Relative movement property can be configured there with the automatically generated variables. Then the element will position itself dynamically. Important: If you add another container element in the reusable visualization, then you should set its scaling type to Fixed . The initial size is set under Position in the Properties view. The visualization with its elements is displayed in the editor: Configure the elements which should behave optimized in the Absolute movement or Relative movement properties with the generated variables. Note the differences in configuration, each of which results in different behavior for the element. Configure the property Absolute movement , Movement top-left : X with Container.Width - Visu.Width in order to move the element horizontally as a whole unit. Y with Container.Height - Visu.Height in order to move the element vertically as a whole unit. Configure the property Relative movement with Movement bottom-right : X with Container.Width - Visu.Width in order to move the lower right corner of the element horizontally. This causes the element to adjust in shape and fill accordingly. Y with Container.Height - Visu.Height in order to move the lower right corner of the element vertically. This causes the element to adjust in shape and fill accordingly. Configuration in Properties Frame Rectangle Polyline Add another visualization to your application to be the superordinate visualization. Use a container element (such as Frame ) to reference other visualizations from the application, project, or libraries. Drag the container element to the visualization and select the Template template visualization from the available visualizations. Important: In the properties of the frame, set the scaling type to Fixed . Slide the size of the container element to the desired size. The elements in the referenced visualization, which have been configured with variable movement properties, automatically follow the container size (offline behavior). Add a WebVisu below the Visualization Manager and configure it as follows: Select the Visualization Manager and click Add Object → WebVisu . In the editor, select the Scaling Options as Isotropic . Example: Offline behavior If you drag the container element wider in the visualization editor, then the dependent configured elements will adapt. In the process, the rectangle moves with the polyline as a unit. The Press button moves its right edge and is displayed as solid.

If you use this as a background, then you can use it as a guide when creating visualizations and correctly place elements accordingly. Example of a \"device image\" as background for a visualization In the Devices view, double-click the Visualization Manager . In the opening dialog, switch to Advanced Settings. In Background Configuration , specify the Image ID of the desired background image. For this purpose, you have an image file of the control panel in the file system, or in an image pool in the project or in a library. Define the desired area within the control panel image where the visualization should be displayed later (for example, the area of the monitor space in the image). To do this, specify the positions of the upper left and lower right corners of this area in pixels. Example: 10 \/ 70 for the top left and 700 \/ 600 for the bottom. Enable the Limit element position within content area option to be able to place the elements only in this area when creating the visualization. In this case, you could also use the Compile warning if element exceeds content area option. Save the settings as default for the current device. Each additional visualization below an application for this device (even in other projects) will now also get the defined background. Now place elements in the visualization as you like. You will notice that this is only possible within the defined \"content area\". In the Visualization options (device image) , you can set in which operating modes (online, offline) the device image should be displayed. " },

For this purpose, you configure input events on visualization elements where follow-up actions are triggered. The combination of user inputs and follow-up actions are defined in the Input configuration of an element. For example, you can select a mouse click an element as the input event and opening a dialog as the input action. Keyboard events can also be configured that trigger actions in a specific visualization view when the events occur. You program this kind of input configuration for a visualization in its Keyboard Configuration editor. In addition, keyboard events can be configured that occur in all visualizations programmed in the application. You configure this kind of input configuration per application below the Visualization Manager in the \"Default Hotkeys\" tab. Input is usually performed with the mouse and keyboard as controlling device. You can also configure a user operation by means of gestures. If a visualization device is not equipped with a mouse, then you can activate standard keyboard handling. Then a user can operate the visualization with the keyboard only by navigating with the arrow keys and triggering events by pressing the Enter key.

"body" : "If you want to deploy a web visualization and securely protect it from third-party access, it is advantageous to set up runtime-based user management for it. Runtime-based user management makes sure that users will log in securely with current technology. The credentials are managed using standard web technologies. In addition, user accounts can be created at runtime via secure channels, user credentials can be managed, and user permissions can be restricted according to the role of the user. For this, it is necessary that the visualization user management is coupled with the device user management. You need to map the groups with their rights in the visualization to the groups in the device. You configure the user accounts centrally on the Users and Groups tab of the device editor. If you do not want this because you value independent user management for your visualization and accept the outdated technology for this, then you can alternatively switch to legacy user management. This is not recommended if your controller supports runtime-based user management. In the SimpleWebvisuLogin.project sample project, which is provided with the standard installation of the development system, a simple password protection is implemented, which at least prevents someone from accessing your controller functionality via the Internet.

This configuration is possible with runtime version 3.5.18.10 and higher. For detailed information about CODESYS device user management and its operation, see: Handling of Device User Management Requirement: A visualization group (example: VISU_ADMIN ) has been assigned to a runtime group (example: RTS_GRP_RESTR ) in the Visualization Manager on the User Management tab. In the device user management, the User_Restr user has been assigned to the RTS_GRP_RESTR group. The RTS_GRP_RESTR group has full View permissions for the controller. In the device user management, on the Access Rights tab, grant the View permission for the UserManagement object to the RTS_GRP_RESTR group. To do this, select the UserManagement object, and in the Rights area on the right side, double-click the View field of the RTS_GRP_RESTR group. This opens a dialog prompting whether or not the changed permissions should also be changed for all child objects. Click No to refuse this action. Double-click the field again and click No again in the next dialog. The symbol is displayed for the View permission. For all other groups (except Administrator ), the permission should have the symbol. To the RTS_GRP_RESTR group, grant the View and Modify permissions for the UserManagement → Users object. The symbol is displayed for both permissions. To the RTS_GRP_RESTR group, grant the View and Modify permissions for those objects of the UserManagement → Groups object which are relevant for the visualization. Access to the groups which are relevant for the visualization is granted to the RTS_GRP_RESTR group. For the respective objects, the symbol is displayed for both permissions. For the RTS_GRP_RESTR group, deny the View permission to the Administrator group. As a result, users of the RTS_GRP_RESTR group cannot extend their permissions. Moreover, select the UserManagement → Groups → Administrator object and deny the View permission to the RTS_GRP_RESTR group. The symbol is displayed.

The requirement is that the CODESYS Visualization add-on is installed in at least version 4.7.0.0 and the runtime system in version >= V3.5 SP20. When the visualization is started, it is displayed in the language set in the browser (for example, de or en ). This language must be available in the project. If the language is not available, then the default texts are displayed. In version 4.6.0.0 and lower, the language was switched for all clients simultaneously.  Requirement: An empty visualization object is inserted into the project and it is open for editing in the visualization editor. There is also a Visualization Manager object. User management is not created for the visualization. The following instructions provide a simplified example: By means of two buttons, the user should be able to toggle the visualization texts between English and German. Static texts in the visualization include the labels \"State, Machine 01\", \"State, Machine 02\", \"English\", and \"German\". These texts are located in the GlobalTextList in English and German. Dynamic texts will describe the state of both machines. The texts are provided in the text list Status_Texts in English ( en ) and German ( de ). Drag a Text Field from the Visualization Toolbox view ( Common Controls category) to the editor view. Specify the value State, Machine M01 in the properties editor for the Texts → Text element property. Copy the element and change the copy label to State, Machine M02 . See also the figure in Step 14 for the following steps. Insert two elements of type Button from the Visualization Toolbox view ( Common Controls category) in the visualization editor. With these elements, the user should be able to toggle the language of the visualization. Specify the text German or English in the properties editor for Texts → Text (4) element property. Double-click and open GlobalTextList in the POUs view. The texts are entered in the Standard (1) column, and the ID s 0 and 1 are assigned automatically as additional information. Add the languages \"de\" and \"en\" and localize the default texts with the localization texts shown in the following figure. Language code Use the ISO 639 code (for example, de, en, it, zh-CHS) to name a language which exists in the visualization. Close the GlobalTextList object. Add two elements of type Rectangle from the Visualization Toolbox view ( Basic category) in the visualization editor. The current state of each machine should be displayed. For managing the texts for describing the states, add an object of type Text List below the application. Name the list Status_Texts . Specify the texts shown in the figure for the standard language (1) and the target languages en and de in the editor of Status_Texts . Close the text list Status_Texts . Select the rectangle element for displaying the state of machine M01. Select the text list Status_Texts from the combo box in the properties editor (2) for the Dynamic texts element property (5). Specify an application variable for Text index that shows the appropriate text index for the state of the machine at runtime. Example: PLC_PRG.ivar_status_m01 . Now configure the user input for both buttons for toggling the language in the visualization. Select the \"German\" button. Double-click Configure of the property Input configuration (6), OnMouseClick . The Input configuration \/ OnMouseClick dialog opens. Select Change the language on the left. Click the arrows to accept the setting to the right. Select de in Language to the right of the dialog in the Input Assistant. Click OK to confirm. In the same way, configure the entry for the second button: English : Text list : Status_Texts , Text index : 3 , Change the language : English). The following figure shows the performed properties configurations for the four visualization elements.

Define the behavior of the button according to user input. When you assign a variable to the Input configuration , Toggle property, you configure a button that behaves like a switch. When you assign a variable to the Input configuration , Tap property, you configure a button that behave like a push button. The Button state variable property controls whether the display of the button is pressed or not pressed. When you insert a button into your visualization, the property is assigned the placeholder <toggle\/tap variable> . This has the effect that the display of the button reacts automatically to user input. When you specify a variable instead of the placeholder, you can program the display of the button yourself. In this way, you define when and how the button is displayed by setting the variable specified in the properties accordingly in the code. Example A visualization consists of the \"push button\" and a text field, which displays the number of button events. If the \"push button\" detects a mouse click at runtime, then the color changes and the button is displayed as pressed. A counter variable is also incremented.

"body" : "A table can also be created to display data arrays in the following way. You multiply a single element that has at least one property which is described by a structured variable. To do this, the single element is configured as a \"template\" and multiplied by means of a command. You can use the Visualization → Multiply Visu Element command to display array data in a visualization. The command multiplies a template element to create an element of the same type for each array component. The layout of the new elements in the visualization is one-dimensional as a row or column, or two-dimensional as a table. To do this, drag an applicable element into the visualization editor. Then configure the properties of the element with array variables and specify the index access placeholder $FIRSTDIM$ as component access. If you have declared a multidimensional array, then you can use the second index access placeholder $SECONDDDIM$ for the additional dimension. Configure the remaining properties as usual with the typical values. The purpose is to create a valid template element. Then execute the Multiply Visu Element command on the template element. Now the dialog with the same name opens. There you define in detail how many elements should be created and where they should be located. After multiplying, the visualization contains as many of the same elements as are indexed using placeholders. In doing so, the settings in the Multiply Visu Element dialog are taken into consideration. All new elements in the properties that were preset with placeholders have these replaced with precise indexes. The remaining properties have been applied and copied without changes. For example, you can have a layout of nine buttons as 3x3 tables, which are all the same size or the same color, but vary in the labeling. The labels are declared as a string array (nine components) and are passed as a value to the Texts -> Text property. Declaration of array variables Example: asText: ARRAY[1..3, 1..3] OF STRING; Element with applicable element type Configuration of at least one property of the applicable element with array variables with index access placeholders Example: Texts , Text property: PLC_PRG.asText[$FIRSTDIM$, $SECONDDIM$] This is possible for all properties that permit a variable as a value (for example, also properties from the \"Animation\" or \"Input\" categories. To configure multiple properties for an element with arrays and index access placeholders, all arrays must have the same structure with the same dimension. The declarations have to be compatible. Configuration of properties that do not vary (and are therefore the same for all generated elements) with the usual values without index access placeholders Example: sButtonTip : STRING := 'This element is created by multiplication' Texts , Tooltip property: %s Text variables , Tooltip variable property: sButtonTip You can still use the placeholder % as usual for the text display of variable values in the properties in Texts .

The visualization user can use the mouse (or other pointing device) to move the dialog to any position. As a result, areas which were hidden when initially opened now become visible. This can be useful if, for example, when an opening dialog obscures information on the user interface. The system remembers the new position for the next opening. When moving, the visualization user usually uses the mouse to grab a dialog in the title bar. For standard dialogs, the title bar is therefore configured as its pointer area. In your own dialogs, the background area is configured for this. However, you can also program any other or additional pointer ranges. To do this, delimit areas with the Invisible Input element and enable its Used as pointer area property. The element must not have an input configuration. This is useful if the background area of the dialog is rather small and therefore difficult to grab, or if the title area is not part of the background area. Requirements The Support client animations and overlay of native elements property is enabled In the Visualization Manager. Note: Moving dialogs is only possible when the overlay feature is enabled.

The texts are managed in text lists. In the frame configuration, the IDs of the text list are then assigned in the Description ID column. Managing the texts in text lists allows you to localize the texts and helps to keep a clear overview. Alternatively, you could also enter a text directly in the Default Value column. The requirement for this is that the field in the Description ID column is empty. As a result, localization is not possible. The descriptions are displayed when the application developer selects the referencing frame element in a superordinate visualization. Then, depending on the selected property, the corresponding text appears in the comment window in the Properties view. Configuring descriptions for the Gauge visualization and its properties In the POUs view, add a text list named PropertyNames . Configure an ID for each property which should output a comment: Click in the blank line of the text list. Open the line editor under the ID column and enter an ID. Configure a default value for the new ID and localize this value for each language. The text list is prepared. The texts are referenceable. Example: Text list with descriptions for the interface The text with the ID Element_Desc is the element description of the Gauge visualization. Typically, the purpose or function is specified here. Switch to the visualization where the texts should be referenced. Make sure that the top part is visible and click the Frame Configuration tab. The Gauge visualization with the frame configuration above is active. In the toolbar, click the command icon. If the command is not available, then an element description already exists in the frame configuration. Only one per frame configuration is allowed. The Element description entry is inserted at the top position. Configure the entry: In the row, click the field in the Description ID column. The line editor opens and brings the button to the Input Assistant. Open the Input Assistant. Select the PropertyNames text list there and then select the ID Element_Desc . Click OK to close the Input Assistant. Press Enter to confirm your selection. The description ID is assigned a text list ID. The selected text is automatically displayed below Default Value . This field is no longer editable. The interface now has an element description. In the frame configuration, assign a description ID for each property in the Description ID column. Continue as described in the Step 3 step. Each interface property now has a description. Reference Gauge in another, superordinate visualization. Switch to the Visualization Toolbox view. Click the Current Project button. Drag the Gauge visualization to the visualization editor. In the Properties view, the interface properties are displayed as configured.

"body" : "Recommendations for data protection In order to minimize the risk of data security breaches, we recommend the following organizational and technical measures for the system that will run your applications: Use the newest versions of the gateway server and web server. Whenever possible, avoid exposing your PLCs and your controller networks to public networks or the Internet. Configure an HTTPS connection (encryption with SSL\/TSL) between the visualization client and the web server. Use additional data link layers for protection, such as VPN for remote access, and install firewall mechanisms. Restrict access to authorized people. Restrict access to the visualization and configure a visualization user management. At commissioning, change any existing default passwords and change them on a regular basis. If you still want to publish your WebVisu, then we strongly recommend that you assign it at least a basic password protection to prevent access to the functionality of your PLC over the Internet. The web-based display variant of CODESYS Visualization allows for remote access, remote monitoring, as well as service and diagnostics of a plant over the Internet. A web browser communicates with SSL encryption via JavaScript with the web server of the controller and displays the visualization by means of HTML5. This technology is supported by almost all browsers and is therefore available on iOS and Android terminals. Visualizations which are run as CODESYS WebVisu are therefore web applications that are displayed in a browser. The requirement for this is that the runtime system of the controller provides a web server with WebVisu support which takes over the communication between the target system and the web browser. The web server starts automatically as soon as an application is started with a WebVisu configuration ( CODESYS WebVisu object). The web server runs until all applications with WebVisu have ended. During this time, a visualization user can monitor and operate the controller in an HTML5-capable web browser in a terminal.

"body" : "Prefer the use of CA-signed certificates. For a certificate to be considered secure by the browser, it must have been signed by a certification authority. As a rule, every browser has a list of trusted certification authorities. Such a certificate can be checked by the browser itself so that no warning message appears in the browser when a secure connection is established. Signing a certificate from one of these trusted certification authorities is not usually free of charge. Alternatively, you could also use a certificate you have created yourself. The disadvantage is that this certificate has to be checked in the browser. The browser issues a warning that the connection is not trusted. You can then add an exception so that this warning does not appear every time this connection is opened. However, to make sure that communication is actually taking place with the correct controller, it is necessary to compare the signature value of the certificate with the signature value of the certificate on your own controller. A certificate is required to establish a secure connection between your browser and the web server via an HTTPS connection. It is advisable to use the CODESYS Security Agent to install a valid control certificate for encrypted communication. Installing the CODESYS Security Agent Click View → Store and sign in. Search for the CODESYS Security Agent and start the download. The package is installed and is listed in Installed Packages . Exit the dialog. Creating a certificate Configure the communication settings and the gateway for your device. Click View → Security Screen and select the Devices tab. Click the symbol there. The view notifies you about installed certificates for the devices found in the network and provides command icons for certificate handling. In the left information list, select the device to which you want to establish a secure connection. Depending on the connection channel, the right information list shows the certificates that are available on this device. For example, certificates can exist for the OPC UA Server , Encrypted Communication , Encrypted Application , and Web Server communication channels. Disabled (grayed out) channels that are marked as (not available) do not have a certificate. In this information list, select the Web Server channel and click the symbol on the left. A dialog opens for certificate settings. Set the key length (example: 3072) and the validity period (example: 365 days). Click OK to close the dialog. Note: The validity period should be as short as possible for security reasons. However, the constant updating of the certificate is time-consuming. If you need the certificate for a longer period of time, then you should balance carefully between security and convenience (rare certificate updates). Now a certificate is created for the web server. When the operation is completed, the certificate data is displayed on the tab. Then restart your device together with the runtime. Download the application with the visualization for the CODESYS WebVisu to this device. Your device is ready for a secure connection. Establishing an HTTPS connection Open your browser and specify the URL address of your web server (example: https:\/\/localhost:443\/webvisu.htm ). The URL has the format: https:\/\/ <IP address\/URL> :443\/<name of HTM file>.htm . The HTML file name has to match the name in the configuration in the Visualization Manager in the WebVisu object. You get the IP address from your device configuration. The browser establishes a connection. If the certificate is not trusted, then a security notice appears. Confirm that you know the risk and want to proceed. You have created a self-signed certificate. Its validity can be validated, for example by the Thumbprint by displaying the thumbprint in the browser and then comparing with the value from the Security Agent. Now the WebVisu page starts. The lock symbol in the browser indicates secure communication. BeagleBone Black If you use a BeagleBone Black as a visualization device, then you need to note that a BeagleBone Black uses port 9090 for its web server. A valid IP address is as follows: http:\/\/192.168.7.2:9090\/webvisu.htm " },

"body" : "In CODESYS Visualization version 4.7.0.0 and higher, you can design responsive visualizations. A responsive design automatically adapts to the size and layout of the display variant. Whether the device is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, a panel, or a smartphone, the specifications of the respective device are taken into account and the size and layout of the visualization are adapted. In order to provide this convenient feature to the visualization user, you need to configure the display variants and the visualization elements depending on the client size. This is relevant for the web visualization because there are different client sizes here. However, the feature can be used in the same way for the target visualization. Sample project: \"Demand-Oriented Design\" Responsive design is particularly suitable for the web visualization. However, the configuration settings also need to be made for the target visualization or the integrated visualization. Preparing the web visualization Under the Visualization Manager, open the WebVisu object. Specify the scaling type. Select the Fixed scaling option. And select the Use automatically detected client size option. With the Fixed scaling type, the contents of the visualization object (main page) are displayed unscaled.

"body" : "With the \"isotropic\" and \"anisotropic\" scaling types, the full contents of a main page is scaled to the display size provided by the client. If the page orientation of a tablet, for example, is rotated from landscape to portrait, then the contents do not match the aspect ratio. Large bars are created and the page cannot be filled optimally. In order to avoid this, it was previously necessary to create a separate page (visualization) for each of the portrait and landscape formats. These are started via the ClientListener with the correct starting page. Now this can be achieved more easily via responsive resizing without having to duplicate the visualization objects. With responsive resizing from landscape to portrait format, tiles which are farther to the right side are moved to the bottom right by an absolute movement. The current page size adapts dynamically to the current client size and the elements are optimally positioned within it. When changing from portrait to landscape format, the elements are moved in the opposite direction. Example The main page of a visualization consists of several \"tiles\" which are programmed with frame elements. These frame elements must be repositioned and moved if the orientation of the visualization changes and they are adapted to the current display size. Moving the tiles in the X and Y direction Configure as follows: Property: Absolute movement , Movement , X : SEL(IsPortrait(Container), 0, -250) Property: Absolute movement , Movement , Y : SEL(IsPortrait(Container), 0, 150) Implementation of IsPortrait for determining the visualization size FUNCTION IsPortrait : BOOL\n VAR_INPUT    sizeProvider : VisuElems.ISizeProvider;\nEND_VAR\nIF sizeProvider.Width < sizeProvider.Height THEN \n IsPortrait := TRUE;\nEND_IF Calculation of the movement in the X and Y direction with typical expressions under the Absolute movement property: " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property.

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T .

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action.

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area.

Element name Example: Status bar Assign individual names for elements so that they are found faster in the element list. Type of element Image Static ID Static ID of an image from an image pool. The image pool can be part of the project or from a library. The ID can be resolved exactly if you specify the full instance path. Instance path for an image with an image pool in the project: <namespace library>.<name of image pool>.<ID image> Example: MyLib.Imagepool.background VisuSymbols.Symbols.Phone : Instance path for an image with an image pool in the VisuSymbols library The namespace for the library ( namespace library ) is optional. If it is missing, then an image pool will be searched for in the project. The dot in front of the image collection ( . ) is optional. When the dot is specified, it indicates an instance path in the project. .Imagepool.background If an image cannot be found using this method, then a substitute search is performed using the image ID. The result is the first matching image ID. In the case of ambiguous IDs, this can lead to the wrong image being displayed. This can be prevented by specifying an exact instance path. Specify the full instance path to avoid conflicts: <namespace path> . <name of image pool> . <image ID> For more information, see: Object: Image Pool Show frame : The image file is displayed with a frame. Clipping Requirement: The Scaling type property is Fixed . : Only part of the visualization is displayed that fits in the element frame. Transparent : The image pixels that have the Transparent color are displayed as transparent. Transparent color Effective only if the Transparent option is activated. The button opens the color selection dialog. This is where you select the transparent color. Scaling type Definition of how an image fits in the element frame. Isotropic : The entire image is displayed in the element frame, either larger or smaller. As a result, the proportion of height and width are retained. If the alignment of the elements to each other should also be retained within a scaled frame element, then note the following. Unwanted horizontal or vertical offsets can be prevented by setting the properties Horizontal alignment and Vertical alignment to Centered . The alignment of the elements is retained and there are no resulting horizontal or vertical offsets. Example: A lamp is centered above a switch. The lamp should remain in the horizontally centered position, even if the frame is resized. Anisotropic : The image resizes automatically to the dimensions of the element frame, filling the entire element frame. As a result, the proportions are not retained. Fixed : The image retains its original size, even if the element frame is resized. Note also that the Clipping option is selected. For each reassignment of an image ID, the element size is adapted automatically to the image size.

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area.If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

If the time is displayed in the trend of the visualization element, then the timestamps are converted to the local time zone of the operating system of the PLC. Change the time zone in the operating system if the times in the trend diagram are not in the zone that you need. You can programmatically switch the local time zone of the system time to universal time (UTC). When the variable VisuElems.Visu_DateTime.DisplayUTC is set to TRUE , the system time is displayed as universal time (UTC). By default, the variable VisuElems.Visu_DateTime.DisplayUTC is set to FALSE so that the system time is displayed in the local time zone. For the display of date and time values, you can extend the respective format string with the time zone code Z . For an output in local system time, the offset is then displayed in universal time (UTC). For example, dd:MM:yyyy HH:mm:ss:ms:Z outputs 01.08.2021 12:00:00:001:+02:00 . When universal time (UTC) is displayed, the UTC code is also displayed. 01.08.2021 10:00:00:001:Z Time stamps X-value of the trend diagram Absolute time stamps The absolute time with date and time is displayed at each tick mark on the time axis. Example: 18.03.2016 12h30m50s Relative time stamps The time period from the start of the recording (=0) is displayed at each tick mark. Example: 5m30s Draw labels on two lines : The timestamps are displayed on two lines (for example, the date is displayed on the first line and the time on the second line). : The timestamp is displayed on one line. Example: 2019-11-01-12:30:50 . Omit irrelevant information in timestamps : The timestamps are displayed in a truncated form (without insignificant information). For example, the date is displayed at the first tick mark, and only the time is displayed at the following tick marks. The Internationalization (format strings) property is not visible and is ignored. : The timestamps are displayed with all information.

When you release the mouse button, the display zooms in on the box and the curve is magnified. To zoom in and out on a multitouch device, move two fingers together or away from each other, respectively. Zooming and panning can work together. Enable   Variable ( BOOL ) that enables or disables zooming. TRUE : Enables zooming Example: PLC_PRG.xZoomEnable Home   Variable ( BOOL ) Rising edge: Reset the displayed curve to the initial state after the display has changed due to zooming. Example: PLC_PRG.xZoomHome Undo   Variable ( BOOL ) Rising edge: Reset the displayed curve to the previous position after the display has changed due to zooming. Example: PLC_PRG.xZoomUndo Is zoomed   Variable ( BOOL ) that indicates whether or not the displayed curve was modified due to zooming. TRUE : Curve setting was zoomed. Example: PLC_PRG.xIsZoomed Pan Panning the displayed curve is done by means of the mouse or the pinch gesture on a multitouch device. It also applies to all axes. At runtime if Enable is TRUE , then you can drag the displayed curve to another position by holding down the left mouse button. To pan the displayed curve on a multitouch device, drag it with one finger to another position. Enable   Variable ( BOOL ) to enable or disable panning. TRUE : Enables panning Example: PLC_PRG.xPanEnable Home   Variable ( BOOL ) Rising edge: Reset the displayed curve to the initial position after the display has changed due to panning. Example: PLC_PRG.xPanHome Is panned   Variable ( BOOL ) whose state indicates whether or not the displayed curve was modified due to zooming. TRUE : Curve setting was panned. Example: PLC_PRG.xIsPanned Enable for Y-axis   Variable ( BOOL ) to enable the zoom or pan action also for the Y axis TRUE : The Y axis is enabled. The control variables described below ( Date Range Start and Date Range End ) can be used to programmatically control the time range of the trend. This allows you to program your trend visualization without the Time Range Picker visualization element. However, if you want a visualization user to be able to specify a time range as well, then add the time range picker element. The times in the time range picker element and in the IEC variables are automatically kept synchronized. Note: Make sure that each trend has its own variable, otherwise the trend recording will stop. Hint: To give the user an indication of why the trend has been halted, the symbol is displayed at the end of the trend axes. When this symbol appears, the current trend has been halted because either Zoom or Pan are active, or because the time range is restricted to older values by variables. Date Range Start   IEC variable ( DATE_AND_TIME , DT , LDATE_AND_TIME , LDT ) for the start time of the time range. For the DT data type, an accuracy of 1s is achieved. If the value changes, then the trend recording is stopped. Example: PLC_PRG.ldtStart . Only one variable (no literal) is allowed. Date Range End   IEC variable ( DATE_AND_TIME , DT , LDATE_AND_TIME , LDT ) for the end time of the time range. For the DT data type, an accuracy of 1s is achieved. If the value changes, then the trend recording reacts as follows: When the value increases, the trend recording is started. When the value decreases, the trend recording is ended. Example: PLC_PRG.ldtEnd . Only one variable (no literal) is allowed. " },

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

Element name Example: Camera_Path_1 Assign individual names for elements so that they are found faster in the element list. Type of element Frame Clipping : If you have set the Scaling type to Fixed , then only that part of the visualization is displayed that fits in the frame. Show frame Displays the frame No frame : The displayed area of the frame does not have borders. Frame : The displayed area of the frame has borders. No frame with offset : The displayed area of the frame does not have a border and the displayed area of the referenced visualization is reduced inwards by one pixel as compared to the frame area. The resulting gap prevents the referenced visualization from touching any adjacent elements. Scaling type Describes how the frame reacts when the visualization is resized: Isotropic : The frame retains its proportions. This allows the ratio of height to width to be preserved, even if the height and width of the visualization have been changed separately. Anisotropic : The frame depends on the size of the visualization, so that height and width of the referenced visualization can be changed separately. Fixed : The original size of the frame is retained, regardless of the visualization size. If you have also selected the Clipping option, then only the fitting part is displayed. Fixed and scrollable : The referenced visualization is displayed without scaling. If the value is greater than the window area of the frame, then scroll bars are added to the frame. To set the position of the scroll bar with a variable, use the Scroll position variable horizontal or Scroll position variable vertical property. Deactivation of the background drawing : To optimize the performance of the visualization, the non-animated elements of the frame element are drawn as a background bitmap. This could result in the elements not being displayed in the expected order. : Deactivation of the background drawing. This can prevent the behavior described above.

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area.If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled.

Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property.

"body" : "The properties contain the configurations for the user input when using the mouse or keyboard. A user input defines an event and one or more actions that are executed when an event occurs. The Configure button opens the Input Configuration dialog. There you can create or edit user inputs. Configured user inputs are listed below the events. They each include the action that is triggered and the setting in short form. Example: Execute ST Code : PLC_PRG.i_x := 0; OnDialogClosed Input event: The user closes the dialog. OnMouseClick Input event: The user clicks the mouse button completely in the element area. The mouse button is clicked and released. OnMouseDown Input event: The user clicks down on the mouse button. OnMouseEnter Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer to the element. OnMouseLeave Input event: The user drags the mouse pointer away from the element. OnMouseMove Input event: The user moves the mouse pointer over the element area. OnMouseUp Input events: The user releases the mouse button within the element area. It is irrelevant whether the user has previously pressed the mouse button inside or outside the element area. The user presses the mouse button within the element area, leaves the element area, and then releases the mouse button. This CODESYS -specific triggering behavior guarantees that actions for key elements are completed. A key element starts an action for OnMouseDown and ends the action for OnMouseUp . Example: A visualization user presses the mouse button within the element area of the key element and then moves the cursor position so that it is located outside of the element area. The action is ended anyway because OnMouseUp is triggered. OnValueChanged Event which triggers follow-up actions due to a change in value Which follow-up actions are triggered is configured in the Input Configuration dialog. The defined follow-up actions and the corresponding configuration are displayed below the element property. The OnValueChanged event can be disabled by the VISU_NO_VALUECHANGED compiler define in the properties dialog of the application. Tap When a mouse click event occurs, the variable defined in Variable is described in the application. The coding depends on the Tap FALSE and Tap on enter if captured options. Variable Requirement: The Tap FALSE option is not activated. Variable ( BOOL ) for the mouse click event TRUE : A mouse click event exists. It lasts as long as the user presses the mouse button over the element. It ends when the button is released. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Example: PLC_PRG.bIsTapped Tap FALSE : The mouse click event leads to a complementary value in Variable . TRUE : A mouse click event does not exist. FALSE : While the mouse click event exists. Tap on enter if captured : During user input, it is also taken into consideration whether the mouse pointer is dragged within the element area or not while the mouse button is pressed. TRUE : While the mouse click event exists and the mouse pointer is moved over the element area. FALSE : A mouse click event does not exist. Or the user moves the mouse pointer outside of the element area while the mouse button is pressed. The value is TRUE again as soon as the user moves the pointer back to the element area. The mouse is then captured. Switch over With the onset of a mouse click event, the variable is set; when the mouse click event is completed, the variable is reset. Variable Variable ( BOOL ) for toggling at the end of the mouse click event This is when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the element area. If the user releases the mouse button while the mouse pointer is outside of the element area, then the mouse click event is not ended and the value is not toggled. The user can cancel a started toggle input by dragging the mouse pointer out of the element area. Toggle on up if captured : The value toggles regardless of where the mouse pointer is when the mouse button is released. The mouse is then captured. Hotkey Shortcut on the element for triggering specific input actions When the hotkey event occurs, the input actions in the Events property are triggered. In this way, it is not the input action itself that leads to this input action, but the mouse input action. Key Key pressed for input action. Example: T The following properties appear when a key is selected. Events None Mouse down : Pressing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property. Mouse up : Releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseUp property. Mouse down\/up : Pressing and releasing the key triggers the input actions that are configured in the OnMouseDown property and the OnMouseUp property. Switch over : Combination with the \"Shift\" key Example: Shift + T . Control : Combination with the \"Ctrl\" key Example: Ctrl + T . Alt : Combination with the \"Alt\" key Example: Alt + T . All keyboard shortcuts and their actions that are configured in the visualization are listed on the Keyboard Configuration tab. " },

Container variable: Container.Height For more information, see: Optimally Adjusting the Position and SizeIncreasing this value at runtime moves the element downwards. Rotation Variable (numeric data type) for the angle of rotation (in degrees) Example: PLC_PRG.iAngle1 . The midpoint of the element rotates at the Center point. This rotation point is shown as the symbol. At runtime, the alignment of the element remains the same with respect to the coordinate system of the visualization. Increasing the value rotates the element to the right. Scaling Variable (integer data type) to trigger a centric stretching Example: PLC_PRG.iScaling The reference point is the Center property. The value 1 shrinks the element by a factor of 0.001 . The value 1000 returns the element to its original size. Interior rotation Variable (numeric data type) for the angle of rotation (in degrees) Example: PLC_PRG.iAngle2 . At runtime, the element rotates about the point of rotation specified in Center according to the value of the variable. In addition, the alignment of the element rotates according to the coordinate system of the visualization. Increasing the value in the code rotates clockwise. The rotation point is shown as the symbol. If a static angle of rotation is specified in the Position → Angle property, then the static angle of rotation is added to the variable angle of rotation (offset) when the visualization is executed. You can combine the variables to a Unit conversion . The X , Y , Rotation , and Interior rotation properties are supported by the \"Client Animation\" functionality. " },

When the variable VisuElems.Visu_DateTime.DisplayUTC is set to TRUE , the system time is displayed as universal time (UTC). By default, the variable VisuElems.Visu_DateTime.DisplayUTC is set to FALSE so that the system time is displayed in the local time zone. For the display of date and time values, you can extend the respective format string with the time zone code Z . For an output in local system time, the offset is then displayed in universal time (UTC). For example, dd:MM:yyyy HH:mm:ss:ms:Z outputs 01.08.2021 12:00:00:001:+02:00 .

This editor is used to define properties for the frame interface and then configure each in detail. If the visualization is referenced in a superordinate visualization with a frame, then the actual values can be configured there by means of the properties configured here, which act as transfer parameters. The frame with the referenced visualization then presents itself just like a visualization element and is supported by the same editors. Call : Automatic when the visualization object is opened In order to keep the frame interface of a visualization clear, we recommend that you pass as few as possible standard frame properties as parameters. When a visualization with a frame interface is referenced by another visualization by means of a frame element, it brings with it the properties displayed here in the tree view. In the referencing visualization, it then presents itself like an ordinary visualization element: with properties categorized and arranged hierarchically. And with editors to help you specify the value with editors that match the data type. Description of the columns Hierarchical tree view with categories Corresponds to the Properties view of a visualization element A frame interface consists of properties which can be thematically grouped and hierarchically arranged using categories. Element description Description which is displayed in the visualization editor when using the visualization as a reference in a frame Property Externally visible property represented as a node of the hierarchical tree view Node types: Category nodes, including subordinates: With identifier (category name) Without configuration A category combines properties into one category, similar to a container (without being able to store values). Allows for the hierarchical structuring of properties Example: Image , Label Nodes, including subordinates: With identifier (property names) With configuration in the columns of the tree view, therefore displayed in normal font Example: Show image , Image Standard property nodes Selected from the properties of the frame In grayed out font to indicate that the configuration is at the frame element, not here The default Position , Center , Absolute movement , and State variables properties are always added to the interface (by default). You can add the Forward inputs standard property. If the Input configuration standard property is also used, then inputs are forwarded both to the frame itself and to the referenced visualization.

"body" : "Multitouch handling This property defines what handles the touch events. This is done either by the visualization or, in the case of the WebVisu, by the browser. With this setting, touch gestures can be performed on various visualization elements. : The visualization processes user input via gestures, touch, and mouse events. The WebVisu does not forward these events to the browser (no scrolling possible). The forwarding of events affects only the WebVisu, not the TargetVisu. : The visualization does not process input events explicitly. Mouse, touch, and gesture events work as usual in the browser. Affected elements Elements with input configuration Element type Frame Element type Tabs Table , Alarm Table , Combo Box, Integer , Combo Box, Array with the Fixed and scrollable property These scroll elements can be scrolled either with a gesture (touch event) or with a scroll bar (mouse event). The scroll bar has to be configured explicitly. Therefore, select the Scroll elements with scrollbar property if an element should be equipped with a scrollbar. Scroll elements with scrollbar : The scroll elements are displayed with a scroll bar. The contents excerpt can be scrolled with the mouse only this way. : Scrolling by panning is enabled. The visualization elements Table , Alarm Table , Combo Box, Integer , Combo Box, Array , and Frame with the Fixed and scrollable property are affected by this option. Semi-transparent drawing : The visualization paints the elements in a semitransparent color. When defining a color, you can also specify the gradient value for transparency. This value is defined in the Transparency property. The leading byte is evaluated in color variables. Default: enabled. Requirement: You have created a new visualization and the display variants can paint with semitransparency. Standard keyboard handling The following user input is provided by default: Tab Configure its behavior in Tab order in the Element list . Shift + Tab Enter Arrow Up Arrow Down Arrow Right Arrow Left Paint disabled elements grayed out : All disabled elements are grayed out without you having configured their element properties, such as color variables. The following results in the disabling of an element: The variable which has been assigned to the State variables , Deactivate inputs element property is set to TRUE . The visualization user management prohibits the user from making entries. The user has Only visible permission. Call after visu initialization Function name. The function is called after initialization. That is the right time to register an additional event handler for the EventManager . Example: VisuInit Implementation of VisuInit : \/\/ This function is called after visu initialization (see Visualization Manager 'Call after visu initialization')\nFUNCTION VisuInit : BOOL\nVAR_INPUT\nEND_VAR\n\/\/ Set the mouse event handler\nVisuElems.VisuElemBase.g_VisuEventManager.SetMouseEventHandler(PLC_PRG.evHandler); Another user case is the registration of the ClientManagerListener for the ClientManager . Responsive visualization size The size of the visualization is refreshed when the client size is changed. The elements in the top-level visualization can be positioned dynamically. The requirement is isotropic or anisotropic scaling. The client size can be queried with the Container.Width and Container.Height variables. Container.Size is the client size for all top-level visualizations. In order for a visualization with repositioned elements to scale correctly again, Visu.Size has to be recalculated. Example: Container.Width - Visu.Width\nContainer.Width - Visu.Width - 50 Sample project for responsive design " },

"body" : "Dialog Settings Symbol: The tab manages the settings for standard dialogs which open when virtual user input is desired, for example, because no external keyboard or mouse is available. The global settings in the Visualization Manager are effective for use in a TargetVisu or WebVisu only. If a corresponding setting is also available in the input configuration of the respective visualization element, then it is used. In the input configuration of an element, you define which action is opened by the standard dialog defined here. Sample project for visualizing dialogs in Structured Text (ST) Source library with dialogs available in visualization Settings for Default Text Input Numpad Dialog representing a virtual numeric keypad Preset: VisuDialogs.Numpad Opens when the visualization user clicks in an input field for a number Keypad Dialog representing a virtual keyboard Preset: VisuDialogs.Keypad Opens when the visualization user clicks in an input field for a text Use text input with limitation Dialog which also displays and controls the value range limiting the input Default: VisuDialogs.TextinputWithLimits : Enables a special dialog for the input restricted to a range of values. This dialog shows the value range accepts values only within the given range. Requirement: Unless the visualization is run as a TargetVisu or WebVisu, the Default Test Input setting has to be configured with Keyboard (in the object of the variant under Visualization Manager , under Input handling option ). Global position settings for numpad \/ keypad Note: The origin of the coordinate system of the visualization window is located in the upper left corner.

Open centered on the element The dialog opens in the middle above the element and hides it. Open next to the element The dialog is placed next to the element dynamically and optimized. Open at defined position X Y The dialog opens at the position set with X and Y . Settings for User Management Dialogs You can configure your visualization with a user management. To do this, configure an element input for opening a user management. The VisuUserManagement library provides ready-made dialog visualizations for this purpose. The library is located in the installation directory (example: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\CODESYS\\4.1.0.0 \\Projects\\Visu\\Dialogs\\VisuUserMgmtDialogs.library ). You can also use other visualizations as user management dialogs. The presets must be changed here in order to do this.

"body" : "Advanced Settings Symbol: This tab is part of the Visualization Manager dialog. Memory Settings Size of memory for visualization Memory size (in bytes) allocated by the visualization at runtime. Default: 400000 Size of memory for visualization (initial value) This is the initialization value for visualization profile V3.5 SP10 and higher. If the memory usage exceeds this value, then the memory is doubled dynamically. Size of paint buffer (per client) Memory size (in bytes) allocated by the visualization per display variant and used for painting actions. Default: 50000 Size of paint buffer (per client, initial value) This is the initialization value for visualization profile V3.5 SP10 and higher. If the memory usage exceeds this value, then the memory is doubled dynamically. File Transfer Mode Transfer visualization files to the PLC : When downloading the application from the visualization directories to the PLC, CODESYS copies files, such as images and text lists, that are referenced by the visualization. A CODESYS TargetVisu needs the files on the PLC, as well as dialogs, that support numerical and keyboard input. Use local visualization files : The visualization uses images and text lists in local directories. Note: In order for the visualization to access local files, the file paths must be relative . You can specify these paths on the Visualization tab of the Project → Project Settings dialog. The settings the Options dialog in Visualization are also considered. Note: It is also necessary for the link type to be set to Link to File for an image. The link type is specified in the image pool. With \"Display variant\", the type of visualization is identified, either WebVisu, TargetVisu, or HMI. A display variant is a connected display medium. In this way, multiple browsers (clients) can be connected at the same time for the display variant WebVisu. Client Settings Maximum number of visualization clients Restricts the number of display variants that are executed at the same time. If you configure elements to vary depending on the display variant, then you have to limit the number of display variants. A visualization receives an ID at runtime that identifies the display variant and processes data accordingly. CODESYS can interrogate the ID with the system variable CURRENTCLIENTID for information about which of the running variants is affected. Example: arr[CURRENTCLIENTID].dwColor Requirement: The library VisuGlobalClientManager is included in the project. Transfer both svg images and converted images The option is visible only if both a WebVisu and TargetVisu are used. This affects images in SVG format only. The option is available if the device description of the controller of the TargetVisu does not support the format \"SVG (full)\". : The images are transferred in PNG or BMP format (for TargetVisu) and also in SVG format (for WebVisu). Not all settings are available for an integrated CODESYS visualization. Background Configuration Image ID File name of the \"device image\". The device image is a background frame which can be displayed for orientation purposes during the creation of visualizations for a specific device type. (This should not be confused with the option of permanently assigning a background image to a visualization). The device image \"represents\" a main visualization and therefore helps to position visualization elements in the individual visualizations. With the position specifications below, an area can be defined within the device image where the individual visualization should be displayed. For instructions, see : Designing a Background, Using a Device ImageTo specify the device image, the ID of an image file from an existing image pool can be entered directly. When you start typing a string into the input field, existing files with matching names are offered for selection. Examples: VisuElemsSpecialControls.IP_ElementImages.ImageSwitcher , company_logo . : Opens the Input Assistant to select a device image from an image pool : Opens the dialog to search the file system for an image file Note: In the Visualization options (device image) , you can set in which operating modes (online, offline) the device image is to be displayed. Content area Left (X), Top (Y) Position of the top left corner of the area where the visualization is displayed. Right (X), Bottom (Y) Position of the bottom right corner of the area where the visualization is displayed. Compile warning if element exceeds content area : If a visualization element is not completely within the range as defined above, then a compile warning is issued. Limit element position within content area : Visualization elements cannot be placed outside of the defined area. Save as default The settings are saved as the default for the device and are used for all visualizations created for this device type. Load default If settings have been changed in Background Configuration , then this command can be used to reload the last ones which were saved as default for the device. " },

"body" : "TargetVisu Symbol: Function : The object is used for configuring CODESYS TargetVisu in order to display the visualization directly on the controller of an integrated or connected panel. Requirement : The CODESYS Control runtime environment is equipped with the CODESYS TargetVisu component. The object itself is inserted below the Visualization Manager. CODESYS TargetVisu can be executed on different platforms, from embedded controllers to powerful PC-based systems on different operating systems. Therefore, it can be run on Windows, Windows Embedded CE, Linux, QNX, or VxWorks. A ready-made adaptation to the graphics interface of the systems is available on these operating systems. An adaptation is required for embedded controllers or other operating systems. In addition, there are device manufacturers that integrate visualizations into external applications by means of ActiveX controls.

Update rate (ms) Refresh rate (in milliseconds) of the visualization Example: 200 Show Used Visualizations The link opens the Visualizations tab in the Visualization Manager editor. The tab provides information about the visualizations downloaded to the display variants. Scaling Options Fixed : Fixed size of the visualization (original size) Isotropic : : The size of the visualization is adapted to the dimensions of the web browser, retaining the proportions of the visualization. Anisotropic : : The size of the visualization is adjusted to the size of the display device, for example a screen. Use scaling options for dialogs : The dialogs (also for keypad and numpad) are scaled as the visualization (drawn with the same scaling factor). This is an advantage when a dialog was created to match the visualization because then they are scaled together. Use automatically detected client size : The visualization fills the screen of the display device completely. Use specified client size : The values in Client height and Client width are used for the size of the visualization. The visualization fills this screen area only. Client height Height of the visualization (in pixels). Client width Width of the visualization (in pixels). Presentation Options Antialiased drawing : Antialiasing is used in the visualization editor for drawing a visualization as a TargetVisu and a TargetVisu variant. Hint: If a horizontal or vertical line is drawn blurry on a specific visualization platform, then this can be corrected by an offset of 0.5px in the direction of the line thickness (see element Absolute movement property, Use REAL values option). Requirement: The platform in use supports REAL coordinates. Default Text Input Input with Touchscreen Text input on the display variant with touchscreen. The keypad or numpad dialog opens. Keyboard Text input on the display variant with an ordinary keyboard or a virtual keyboard (on Linux for example) Effect: When you configure a user input for default text input, select an input configuration for input action Write Variable , and configure the Input type as Default , then the settings are used here.

The web server allows for the communication between the target system and the web browser. Start visualization Name of the visualization where the start is displayed as CODESYS WebVisu . Hint: Use the Input Assistant to select another visualization. Name of .htm file Base URL of the web page. The URL is also specified as the address in the web browser. Example: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/webvisu.htm Note: If you use a BeagleBone Black as a visualization device, then you need to note that a BeagleBone Black uses port 9090 for its web server. A valid IP address is as follows: http:\/\/192.168.7.2:9090\/webvisu.htm Use as default page : The page specified under Name of .htm file is preset as the default page. When a user enters the above IP address together with the port of the web server running on the controller as the URL ( http:\/\/<IP address of web server>:<port of web server>) , this page is opened. Example: http:\/\/localhost:8080 Notice: Even if you have created multiple web visualizations, you can activate this option for exactly one web page only and therefore preset only one page as the default page.

The order in the element list from top to bottom describes the order of the elements on the display layers of the visualization from back to front. When you insert elements consecutively, they are arranged starting from the \"back\" (position 0) on one layer forward. When you use the commands in the Visualization → Order menu to move an element from front to back in the editor window, the element list refreshes accordingly. Type Element type and symbol, as used in the Visualization ToolBox view, as well as the element number that specifies the display layer. #0 = layer furthest back X , Position of the upper left corner of the element (0,0 = upper left corner of the visualization area). Y Width Dimensions of the element (in pixels) Height ID Internally assigned element identifier Name Element name as defined in Properties → Element name Access Rights The lock symbol indicates the restricted behavior of an element for some user groups. Tab Order Position within the order in which you can jump from element to element in the editor by means of the tab key when the default keyboard usage is activated. The activation is done in the visualization manager, on the settings tab. Note that elements within a group or group box have their own order (different hierarchy level). The tab order initially corresponds to the order in which the elements are arranged on the layers from back to front ( Type above). To change the position in the order for an element, you can specify a different number directly in the table field. You can also use the Move to Position context menu command to open a dialog for specifying a new position. Bold fonts indicate changed position specifications. By removing the displayed value, you exclude the element from the selection using tab or arrow keys. You can use the Reset to Default context menu command to reset a changed position to the original position. This can be done simultaneously for a multiselection of elements when they do not belong to different hierarchy levels (groupings). " },

OK When the dialog is closed, the selected controls are inserted into the visualization editor and, if necessary, its control variables are created as local variables of the visualization. They are declared in the interface editor and they are used by the control ( Input configuration → Toggle → Variable property) and by the trace element ( Control variables property). The control writes to the variable and the trace element reads the variable.

Requirement: The visualization is executed as a CODESYS WebVisu . URL As a literal in single straight quotation marks As a variable (STRING) If a parameter is not specified, then the web page is displayed in a new window or a new tab. If 'replace' is specified, then the CODESYS WebVisu is replaced by the web page. Command: Read Recipe Command 1st parameter 2nd parameter ReadRecipe 'RecipeDefinitionForModules' 'RecipeModuleA' Name of the recipe definition As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) Name of the recipe As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) At visualization runtime, the controller reads the actual values from the variables of the recipe definition and writes them to the specified recipe. The values are saved implicitly (to a file on the controller) and shown in the recipe definition in the Recipe Manager of CODESYS . In other words, the recipe which is managed in CODESYS is updated with values from the controller. Command: Write Recipe Command 1. Parameters 2. Parameters WriteRecipe PLC_PRG.stRecipeDef PLC_PRG.stRecipe Name of the affected recipe definition As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) Name of the recipe (from the recipe definition) As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) At visualization runtime, the values of the recipe are written to the variables on the controller as they are in the Recipe Manager.

Parameters SaveRecipeAs PLC_PRG.stRecipeDef PLC_PRG.stRecipe Name of the affected recipe definition As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) Name of the affected recipe that is updated and saved to a file As a literal As a variable ( STRING ) Optional parameter: If you do not specify a transfer parameter here, then the values from the recipe variables are saved only the file that is specified later. The implicit recipe files are not updated. At visualization runtime, the Save Recipe as dialog opens and prompts the user for a file name and a storage location on the controller. The file name must not be <recipe>.<recipe definition> . The file extension is .txtrecipe . The user can then save the file that includes the actual values from the recipe variables. If a transfer parameter is not specified in the 2nd parameter, then the file is saved without changing an implicit recipe file. If a transfer parameter is given in the 2nd parameter, then the implicit recipe file is also updated. Note: If the Save recipe changes to recipe files automatically option is selected in the Recipe Manager – General tab, then the recipe definition in CODESYS and the implicit recipe files are kept the same automatically. Note: Implicit (automatically generated) recipe files exist on the controller with names in the following syntax: <recipe>.<recipe definition>.txtrecipe . These are typically used in the application as a buffer when reading and writing recipe variables.

It provides the visualization user with a file list that is located in the file system of the controller and filters by the extension txtrecipe . The selected file is downloaded. Then the recipes from the file are written to the implicit files and read to the given recipe in the recipe definition of the Recipe Manager. Requirement: The file was created with the SaveRecipeAs command. Command: Create Recipe Command 1. Parameters 2. Parameters CreateRecipe PLC_PRG.stRecipeDef PLC_PRG.stRecipe_New Name of the affected recipe definition As a literal As a variable (STRING) Name of the new recipe As a literal As a variable (STRING) At visualization runtime, a new recipe is created in the given recipe definition.

"body" : "File Transfer With the File Transfer input action, a file can be transferred from an operating variant (target or web visualization) to the PLC as well as to and from the PLC. This works either by means of a file transfer ( Type : File ) or streaming ( Type : Streaming ). The action has the effect that a file selection dialog is displayed in the visualization at runtime. There the visualization user can select a file which will be transferred either to or from the PLC: For a transfer from a PLC to the visualization, the Save File dialog opens. For the transfer from the visualization to the PLC, the Open File dialog opens. Transfer Direction Direction of file transfer From PLC to Visualization The object specified in File name or Streaming instance name is transferred from the PLC to the visualization. The Save File file selection dialog is displayed in the visualization at runtime. From Visualization to PLC The file specified by the visualization user is transferred to the PLC and saved in the file path specified in File name or Streaming instance name . The Open File file selection dialog is displayed in the visualization at runtime. Type Determines how the file is transferred Transfer type File : By file transfer Transfer type Streaming : By streaming Type File The data transfer is done by file transfer. File name File path (type STRING ) which describes the file in the file system Variable Example: strTransferFile: STRING; Literal with relative path Example: '\/Recipes\/Recipe_1.txt' saves the file in the directory Recipes . Literal with placeholder $PLCLOGIC$ PlcLogic is the default resolution for the directory placeholder $PLCLOGIC$ . Example: '$$PLCLOGIC$$\/test.txt' saves the file in the directory PlcLogic . Example: '$$PLCLOGIC$$\/MyData\/test.txt' saves the file in the directory PlcLogic\/MyData . Literal with placeholder $VISU$ visu is the default resolution for the placeholder $VISU$ . Example: '$$VISU$$\/test.txt' save the file in the subdirectory PlcLogic\/visu . Alternatively, 'visu\/test.txt' can also be specified. Literal with absolute path Example: 'E:\\temp\\test.txt' Note: These kinds of file paths are not always supported. If a user specifies the file path in the visualization by means of a Text Field element, the masking character $ must not be included: $VISU$\/dummy.txt In the case that the file path is specified by the user, it should be checked by the application in order to prevent files from being read or overwritten accidentally. Type Streaming The data transfer is done by streaming. Streaming instance name Instance path (type IVisuStreamWriter or IVisuStreamReader ) which describes the object in the file system of the controller Type IVisuStreamReader for transfer direction From PLC to Visualization Type IVisuStreamWriter for transfer direction From Visualization to PLC Control flags Note: The variable is evaluated only for transfer direction From Visualization to PLC . Variable (type DWORD ) Determines how the object (file or instance object) is handled on the file system of the PLC. Two flags are provided for this with which the variable can be set. Flag 1: VisuElems.VisuEnumFileTransferControlFlags.UseOriginalFileName Flag 2: VisuElems.VisuEnumFileTransferControlFlags.ConfirmFileOverwriteInPlc Options No flag set: The user selects a file which is saved in the path specified in File name or Streaming instance name . Flag 1 is set: The path, which is specified by the user at visualization runtime, is applied and used as the path in the PLC file system. Both flags are set: The path is also checked. If an object already exists in the path specified on the client side, then a message prompt is displayed in the visualization. There the visualization user can confirm that the file will be overwritten. Example: dwControlFlag Example The transfer direction is From Visualization to PLC (write). Example: A new recipe file Recipes\/Recipe_2021.txt has been created in the visualization device. The visualization user selects this file and wants to save the file on the PLC under the same name. Because the control flags are set accordingly, a message window opens and the visualization user can confirm that the file will be overwritten.

The Close dialog input action closes the window. A dialog usually includes an OK button or Cancel button at the bottom edge for confirming or rejecting user input, and for closing the dialog. A simple dialog or a dialog prompt includes only a question or information and buttons for closing the dialog with either Yes or No . A dialog is always part of a user interface.

Numpad\/ Keypad\/ dialog for input configuration Visualization type for a visualization that displays a virtual numeric keypad or a virtual keyboard It opens when the user is prompted to specify a text. The input action for this is Write Variable . The interface of this visualization also have to conform with the interfaces for the standard visualizations for the numeric keypad or the keyboard that provides the VisuDialogs library: Numpad , Keypad , NumpadExtended , or TextinputwithLimits . The VisuDialogs library contains templates for virtual keyboards and numeric keypads. Login visualization Visualization type for the login page of a WebVisu or TargetVisu for which runtime-based user management is configured Only a certain selection of visualization elements is available for this visualization type. Because no IEC variables can be used, multiple placeholders are available for the configuration of the input fields and buttons. With the input configuration, it is possible to configure a link to a web page with the Execute Command input action and the Navigate to URL (WebVisu) command on the login page. When the visualization is started, the login page is displayed first, where the user has to enter the user name and the user password. Dialog is opaque : The screen area that is covered by the dialog is not refreshed. This has a positive effect on the character and input performance.

Include background image : All elements and the background image are completely visible. : All elements are visible, but a larger background image is truncated. Use specified visualization size : The Height and Width values define the window size of the visualization (in pixels). Internal : Internal POU of a library (library visualization) A visualization marked as Internal in a CODESYS library project is treated as usual. The visualization can be opened and its name appears in list boxes. If this library is used in a project, then the visualizations marked as Internal are not visible in the project. This option is intended for library developers to mark a visualization as a library object. The visualization is not visible outside of the library. Use visualization and container size properties : For visualizations which are displayed in a superordinate container element or in a superordinate visualization, variables for the size of the available area are generated automatically. In this way, the visualization can adapt to the available area which is provided by the referencing element. Variables which can be passed in the Absolute movement property: Container.Width , Container.Height Variables for the size of the available area: In this case, it is the size of the referencing element of type Frame or Tabs . Visu.Width , Visu.Height Variables for the size of the available area: In this case, it is the size of the referencing visualization. Hint: Disable this option if your application has more than one variable named Container or Visu . Toolbox Display Use custom category : The element is displayed under a custom localized category, corresponding to the specified text list entry. : A general visualization category can be selected. Category Category name for the toolbox under which the visualization object is displayed Defined as a text list entry <text list>.<ID> which refers to the multilingual category names Image Image (SVG) for the toolbox which is displayed as a thumbnail for the element Defined as an entry in the image pool <image pool>.<ID> which refers to an SVG image " },

Instead of all points being displayed in the XY chart, only the points from Minimum to Maximum are displayed. Minimum and Maximum are indexes that must not violate the index limits. The compiler also monitors this. Pick the index limits of the array declaration. Example: <variable name> : ARRAY [ <lower index bound> .. <upper index bound> ] OF <data type>; Moreover, you can limit the display programmatically in the instance of VisuStructXYChartCurve . The structure elements diIndexMin and diIndexMax are available for this purpose. They have the same function as Minimum and Maximum . At runtime, the values are copied here into these structure elements. In addition, you can limit the display area only one-sided, and specify only one Minimum or only one Maximum . When you do not specify a limit here or in the structure, the curve is displayed completely. When you specify variables (numeric data type) as array indices, you can make the display dynamic.

Image : Background with image; configured in the input field Image ID Color Style color from the list box. Example: LightGreen Fixed value that is selected in the color dialog Available when the Plain color type is selected Transparency Value (0 to 255) for defining the transparency of the selected color Example 255 : The color is opaque. 0 : The color is completely transparent. Available when the Plain color type is selected Image ID <image pool name> . <ID> Example: Images.Logo Available when the Image type is selected Transparent color : Background displayed with transparent color Style color from the list box Example: LightGreen Fixed value that is selected in the color dialog Available when the Image type is selected Scaling type Isotropic : The entire image is displayed in the element frame, either larger or smaller. As a result, the proportion of height and width are retained. Anisotropic : The image resizes automatically to the dimensions of the element frame, filling the entire element frame. As a result, the proportions are not retained. Fixed : The image retains its original size, even if the element frame is resized. Note also that the clipping option is selected. Available when the Image type is selected Extended Variables Axis variable Variable (data type VisuStructXYChartAxis from the VisuElemXYChart library) The variable configured here is initialized with the static configuration. At runtime, the Cartesian XY Chart element responds to changes in this structure. As a result, the element can be controlled programmatically at runtime. Note: When this structure is controlled programmatically, problems can result with the order of assignments. Therefore, the application should assign its initial values only as soon as the visualization element is initialized and the structure variable iInitialized has switched to 1. The iInitialized variable is available only as of CODESYS version SP16. For older versions, the problem with the order cannot be solved neatly. See example: Axis variable Example: Axis variable Declaration PROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n XYAxis : VisuStructXYChartAxis;\nEND_VAR Assignment IF XYCurve.iInitialized > 0 THEN\n XYAxis.rMin := 12.0; \/\/ minimum axis value\n XYAxis.rMax := 36.0; \/\/ maximum axis value\nEND_IF Extended Display Parameters Display ruler Axes overlap in origin Display numbers Display of maximum number Display of minimum number Display of numbers in the middle Overwrite numbers : The axis is displayed accordingly. Number rotation angle Angle (in degrees) which specifies how many degrees the numbers of the axis label rotate Example: 45 The rotation is clockwise, whereby the zero degrees position is the usual display position. The degree number can be negative. When a rotation is set, the setting is not considered in Overwrite numbers . As a result, the displayed numbers can overlap. Rotation aligned to mark : The side of the imaginary box, where the number is displayed, is aligned to the reference mark. : The center of the imaginary box, where the number is displayed, is aligned to the reference mark. Texts for numbers replacing In doing so, the index of the text list has to be equal to the number being replaced. Indexes may be negative and fractional (with decimal places). The rotation function is also available for texts. We highly recommend that you prepare short text lists. The element can process a maximum of 100 texts for each axis. Format string For formatting the output text of the axis. Direct specification of a format string Example: dd:MM:yyyy HH:mm:ss:ms Text list entry which refers to a localized format string Example: TextList.ID In the text list, the format string can be specified differently for different languages. Accordingly, the text is displayed depending on the language. The format string for date\/time is used if the data for this axis is of type DATE\/TIME\/TOD\/DT. The date and time are then displayed in two lines. The line break occurs between the date and time format. Label Text ID <text list name> . <ID> Example: Texts.mm (The text list Texts is already available in the project.) Color : Label in the axis color Style color from the list box. Example: LightGreen Fixed value that is selected in the color dialog Available when Test ID is initialized Rotation 0° : Parallel to the axis 90° : Rotated on the axis 270° : Rotated on the axis Available when Test ID is initialized. Font Font style from the list box. Example: Annotation Fixed value which is selected in the default Font dialog Available when Test ID is initialized Level Lines Line along the axis The line is horizontal for a Y-axis and vertical for an X-axis. A maximum of 10 lines are possible. Line number Addresses the line and results in the corresponding parameter settings being displayed for this line in the window area below Parameter for line <n> . Example: 3 Parameter for line <n> Value Example: 3 A maximum of 10 lines are possible. Line style Example: Dots Line width Example: 2 Color : Line of the level line value in the axis color Style color from the list box. Example: LightGreen Fixed value that is selected in the color dialog Label text ID <text list name> . <ID> Example: Texts.mm (The text list Texts is already available in the project.)

"body" : "Trend Recording Symbol: Timeout for trend recording During a trend recording, it can happen that the application task triggers a timeout that is caught with an exception when transitioning from Running to Stop . Causes can be that file operations with the SQLite database are taking too long or that too many variables are being recorded. This usually happens on a target device with weak performance. You can avoid the occurrence of an exception: Configure the trend recording with less memory demand so that the amount of data that is stored is adapted to the target system. Reduce the number of variables. In a trend recording, you configure which data is recorded, where, and in which time interval.

Record by time interval : Recording is done after the specified time interval (default setting). Note: When this option is selected, the Interval Settings group is displayed below. There you configure the frequency of the recording by specifying a time interval. Record depending on task : Recording is done in the frequency according to the specified task. Note: When this option is selected, the Task Settings group is displayed below. There you configure the frequency for the recording by specifying a task. Interval Settings Time interval Example: 6000 in ms Select a time unit from the list box (ms , s , m , h , d ). Task priority (0..31) Default value: 15 Task Settings Task Task where the data is recorded This means that the recording is equidistant per task cycle (or a multiple of the task cycle). Example: MainTask Click to open a list box with all tasks available in the project. Hint: In general, the trend recording runs in the same task as the main program. Task priority (0..31) Default value: 15 Advanced settings Measure in every n-th cycle Frequency that the runtime system records data, depending on the number of processed task cycles. Select a value from the list box or type a value into the input field. Example: 1h1m1s1ms Example: 10 CODESYS uses the settings from the task configuration to calculate the time interval according to the frequency. Therefore, the calculation is possible only if at least the task cycle time is set. The result is displayed to the right of the input field, outside the table in a standardized style. Time interval, specified as a multiple of the task cycle Default: 1 means that data is recorded in each task cycle. Hint: The time interval which results in the multiple is displayed after the input field. Additional runtime buffer Length of the time interval when the runtime system can record more data Example: 1000 Time interval (in ms ) for an additional runtime buffer If a delay occurs when \"writing away\" data in the runtime system component, then there is a risk of data loss due to overwriting. In this case, the runtime system uses the addition buffer. Common Settings Record condition Record condition by which the data was recorded: IEC variable of type INT . The condition is fulfilled for TRUE . Bit access to an integer variable. The condition is fulfilled for 1 . As read access to a property The contents of a pointer are not permitted. Note: If no condition is defined, then the recording starts automatically. Measurement slowdown factor Factor (numeric data type as literal or variable >= 1 Example: 5 The factor is multiplied by the interval specified in Measure in every n-th cycle . This results in the actual recording interval. Measure in every n-th cycle = 2 and Measurement slowdown factor = 5 means that the measurement is only recorded every 10 task cycles. Resolution Example: ms Resolution which the application saves the timestamp Select a time unit from the list box. Note: If the task where the trend object is executed has a cycle time of 1 ms or less, then you should set the resolution of the timestamp to 1 µs . Trend Storage Maximum number of variables Example: 10 Maximum number of trend variables which can be managed in the database If you increase this value afterwards, then CODESYS will perform a download and reconfigure the database. Store every N milliseconds Time interval (in ms) when the CmpTraceMgr runtime system component buffers the sampled data before storing it persistently in the database Example: 10000 The application internally calculates the number of task cycles from the time interval. The duration of a task cycle is defined in the task configuration. A high value results in a better runtime performance. The disadvantage of this is that the risk of the loss of data is increased in case of a crash or shutdown of the controller. A low value reduces this risk. The disadvantage here is that the control of a trend visualization becomes more sluggish with large amounts of data. Limit No limit : The number of data sets which can be recorded is unlimited. Note: This is not recommended. Maximum number of records : Maximum number of data sets which are stored in the database. Example: 100 Note: A data set consists of the values of the trend variables and the timestamp. Estimated database size The approximate file size is specified next to the Maximum number of records field. Example: 2 MB The estimated file size depends on the following: Maximum number of set entries Number of variables and their data types Whether saved values are large or small Therefore, the actual data size may differ significantly. Maximum storage size : Maximum size of the trend storage in number of storage units In the list box, select a storage unit (kilobyte KB , megabyte MB , or gigabyte GB ). Example: 16 The application internally calculates the number of data records. " },

"body" : "The CODESYS Visualization add-on provides all the technical capabilities you need to implement a comprehensive alarm and notification system for your application. The visualization users should get specific information about the current state of the running application. They should be alerted in the event of critical states and faults. The alarms are typed, prioritized, and clearly displayed according to their alarm state. The visualization user is responsible for the task of acknowledging the alarms and initiating countermeasures. It is possible to archive triggered alarms. As an application developer, you will get support when creating an alarm management system. The Alarm Configuration object is at the top. Below these are the alarm classes, where the basic properties such as priority, acknowledgement method, notification actions, and display options are defined. The objects of the alarm groups are also included. Alarm definitions for similar alarms are listed together in an alarm group. In addition, the handling of alarms with regard to deactivation, archiving, and the display of alarm instances is specified and, in particular, the alarm definitions are defined. An alarm is defined by a unique ID and a detailed observation type (IEC expression with the project or application variable to be observed). Moreover, it is based on an alarm class. The message to be displayed can also be supplemented with information from latch variables. The behavior of the alarm can be influenced by an on-delay time and off-delay time. By assigning a higher-priority alarm, the alarm can be acknowledged at the same time as a higher-priority alarm. As a result, the acknowledgement of alarms can be issued in a structured way. A text list with the same name is assigned to the alarm group. This contains the alarm messages and notifications and these can be localized here. The AlarmManager library is available for programmatic handling of the configured alarms in the application. If you use library POUs, then these can be monitored with alarm definitions. To do this, you can generate alarm instances. You can use the Alarm Table and Alarm Banner visualization elements to visualize your alarm management. The visualization user will be notified and alerted about the state of the system, and subsequent inputs and acknowledgements will be processed. The visualization user can react to alarm situations according to the defined emergency strategy. As an application developer, you set up the procedure in an alarm situation in the alarm configuration as an \"acknowledgement method\". An alarm management which also includes remote devices (distributed alarms) is possible when an HMI device is connected in the network.

Configure the alarm class as follows: Priority : 10 Archiving The triggered alarms are archived at runtime. Note: When you define alarms with this kind of alarm class in an alarm group, you also need to assign an object for alarm storage to this alarm group. Otherwise archiving will not work. At runtime, all state transitions of alarms of the alarms are permanently stored in an SQLite database. At the same time, the contents of the database can be displayed as an alarm table. For this, the History control variable of the alarm table must be set to TRUE . Acknowledgement method : REP_ACK Acknowledge separately The visualization user must acknowledge each alarm of this class individually. Configure a notification action for the state transitions as follows: In the Notification Actions group, double-click in the Action column. Select the Variable action and press the Enter key to confirm your selection. Input fields will be displayed below the list of notification actions in order to configure the new action. In your IEC program, declare the bPartsShortage control variable If necessary and enter it in the Variable input field. In the input field on the right, specify the value TRUE . The action is inserted. By default, the Deactivate and Confirm state transitions are selected. This means that the variable action is executed for both state transitions and the variable is automatically set for both transitions. A summary of the configuration is displayed in the Details column: PLC_PRG.bPartsShortage := TRUE . Leave the option in the Activate column selected, and clear the Deactivate and Confirm state transitions. The action is only executed with the \" activate \" transition. In the Display Options for Alarm Table\/Alarm Banner group, configure the alarm display for the visualization as follows: Configure the display for the Active state: Double-click the corresponding cell in the Active row and the Background Color column. Select red as the color. Double-click the corresponding cell in the Waiting for confirmation row and the Background Color column. Select yellow as the color. The AC_PartsShortage alarm class is programmed. " },

For this purpose, the alarm is linked to a variable which is observed. To do this, configure the alarm as a Digital observation type and specify an alarm condition. Then assign a latch variable to the alarm. Requirement: A suitable PartsShortage alarm class and DatabaseFileAlarmStorage alarm storage are already configured in the alarm management of the application. Iin the device tree select the Alarm Configuration object. Click the Project → Add Object → Alarm Group command. Assign the name AG_PartsShortage to the alarm group. The AG_PartsShortage alarm group and the text list of the same name are listed in the device tree. In the editor, you can configure the alarm group. Create an alarm. Double-click in the Observation Type column and select the Digital observation type. The alarm is created and is displayed in the alarm list. In the Digital group, configure the observation as follows: In the Expression field, specify the observation variable directly or use the Input Assistant. bPart1Empty In the input field on the right, specify the value TRUE . Leave the comparison operator = between the two expressions. The expression (which acts as an observation condition) (PLC_PRG.bPart1Empty) = (TRUE) is displayed in the Details column. Configure the alarm as follows: Class to AC_PartsShortage Message to Parts shortage at Station 1 – Fill level: <LATCH1> <LATCH1> is a placeholder for Latch Var 1 . The value of this variable provides additional information about the alarm. In this example, it is the fill level at the time the alarm becomes active. It is possible to configure the alarm visualization in such a way that the alarms can be filtered by the value of a latch variable. On-Delay Time to T#5s Latch Var 1 to iFillLevel Check that you have already made the configuration for archiving. Note: You need to specify an alarm storage here because you have defined an alarm of a class with archiving. If the bPart1Empty variable switches to TRUE at runtime, then a message is issued by the alarm management. The value of the iFillLevel variable is output with the message. The acknowledgement behavior and the display are executed according to the AC_PartsShortage alarm class. The alarm is archived. According to the value of the latch variables defined for the alarm, you can filter the alarms in an alarm visualization. To do this, configure the Alarm Table or Alarm Banner elements accordingly and program an element for specifying the filter value.

"body" : " Sample project: Filtering Alarms by Latch and Time Variables When a large number of alarm events occur, it can be an advantage for the visualization user if that large number can be reduced by searching for a criterion such as the contents of a latch variable. For example, if the latch variable 1 contains the error number of the alarm, then the visualization user can filter by this. The user enters the number, which is then compared with the values of the latch variables of the alarms. Then only the alarm with this number is displayed. The following instructions show you an example of how to configure the alarm definition for the search by criteria. Behavior in the event of an unacknowledged alarm When an alarm definition has been configured with a latch variable, for example with an INT variable for a parameterized error message, the current value of the latch variable is archived at runtime. This value changes only if the associated alarm (error message) is acknowledged by the visualization user. The value of a latch variable is always updated when the alarm changes to the active state. As a result, several consecutive error messages that have not yet been acknowledged get the incorrectly archived value. This applies not only to the initial transition to the active state, but also for example when a re-alarm is triggered. Configuration of alarm definitions for filters In the application code, declare a string variable ( GVL ) for the filter. It should be possible to search for a specific error ID at runtime. sFilter : WSTRING; The variable for the value being searched for is declared. This variable is used as an input variable for the search criterion to search for a string In the alarm group, add latch variables to the alarm definitions: Open the Alarmgroup_LatchVars alarm group. Add another latch variable to the list of alarm definitions. Hint: The Add latch var column command is located in the context menu of the alarm group editor. An IEC variable is passed in the Latch Var 3 column: PLC_PRG.arLatchValues[] Their values should be issued in Message 2 at runtime. Add another message column to the alarm definition. Hint: The Supplement message column command is located in the context menu of the alarm group editor. Supplement Message 2 with the latch placeholder for latch variable 3: Another latch variable: <LATCH3> The alarm group defines alarms with messages supplemented by latch variable values. In the application code ( GVL ), define an integer enumeration eFiltType for the filter type. eFiltType : VisuElemsAlarm.EFilterLatchContent; EfilterLatchContent is an enumeration defined in the library AlarmManager with the following filter types: 0 : Filtering is disabled. 1 : The variable for filtering is a string literal. The latch variable must be type-compliant. For example, you can search for 'Error 1' . 2 : The variable for filtering contains a string which must be interpreted as IEC notation. Alarm messages are filtered for latch variable values which are typed literals according to IEC 61131-3. T#1h2s , DINT#15 , REAL#1.5 , or FALSE 3 : The variable for filtering contains a string which must be interpreted as a number. Examples: \"123\", \"456.4\". Alarm messages are filtered for latch variable values which contain numbers ( LINT literal values). Therefore, the value of the latch variable must be in the range of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. For all other values, the behavior is currently not defined. At runtime, the visualization user can specify how the filtering should be done. Only those alarms are displayed which match the search criterion specified in the filter variable in the latch variables. Program the alarm visualization for the Rectangle , Button , and Alarm Table visualization elements with an input configuration for the filter type as follows: Add a Rectangle element for specifying the search string. The rectangle element with the Text element property set to %s and Text variable element property set to GVL.sFilter . The visualization user can enter a search string at runtime. Add a button element with an input configuration for the filter start. The Write Variable action is programmed for the filter variable in the input configuration: GVL.sFilter Configure the alarm table. In the visualization editor, select the element and configure its properties as follows: The Alarm configuration property → Filter by latch1 → Filter variable is set to GVL.sFilter . The Alarm configuration property → Filter by latch1 → Filter type is set to GVL.eFiltType . The filtering is configured.

In concrete terms, this means that you create an alarm group template object for the variables of such POUs and configure alarm definitions in them. The alarm group template object for the POU object is then located in parallel in the POU tree or device tree. The alarm definitions from this are later instantiated in the application in the Alarm Configuration object in order to perform an alarm check at runtime. As an application developer, you can use library POUs which include alarm definitions for the supported creation of an alarm configuration. You will get support with alarm configuration throughout the entire development process of your application. Below your application, add an alarm configuration. A special generation cycle then creates the alarms for the instances of function blocks with alarm definitions. To do this, execute the Create or update alarm instances command so that alarm instances are also created for all instances. You can continue with the editing of the alarm configuration. For example, you can deselect individual alarm instances. To keep the application code consistent with the alarm configuration, the completeness and correctness of the alarm instances is checked when the IEC code is compiled. The result is displayed in the message view so that you are always informed about the state of the alarm configuration. If you do not want this, then you can disable the Check alarm instances during compilation option in the alarm configuration.

Depending on the selected observation type, input fields for additional required parameters are available below the table. ID Unique ID which corresponds to an ID in the associated text list You can change the ID in the ID field of the table. The ID must always be unique within the alarm group. Important: A change of the ID in the alarm table also directly causes a change in the text list, and the other way around. Observation Type Observation type selected from the list box Depending on the type, various input fields are available below the alarm table to define the alarm condition and help you configure the alarm condition. See the following tables for the individual observation types: Digital , Upper limit , Lower limit , Outside range , Inside the range , Change , Event (API) , Alarm (API) Details Alarm condition The details for the observation type (configured in the fields below the table) define the conditions under which the alarm is triggered. You can also specify the condition directly into the field. If you input an expression that does not match the currently selected observation type, the type is automatically adapted. Deactivation Optional Variable for deactivating the alarm Class Assigned alarm class Message Required Entry of a message text (message), which can contain placeholders for information from latch variables ( placeholders for data from a latch variable ) and can be supplemented with line breaks ( Ctrl + Enter ). The text entered here is automatically entered in the text list of the alarm group. When an alarm is triggered, this message is displayed in the alarm elements ( Alarm Table, Alarm Banner) . On-Delay Time Time for switch-on delay Defines the minimum time that the alarm condition must be fulfilled before the alarm is triggered. This can be used to suppress brief alarm events. Example: T#2s IEC 61131-compliant format (example: T#2ms). Off-Delay Time Time for switch-off delay Defines the minimum time that the alarm condition must be inactive before an alarm is treated as inactive. This can be used in the same way as the switch-on delay to ignore short-term value changes. Example: T#4s Latch Var 1 Latch Var 2 Variable with scalar type (8 bytes), STRING or WSTRING Latch variables are used to record additional values when an alarm is active. This makes it possible to provide additional information about the alarm. For example, when observing a motor speed, the temperature and the current are also recorded. By default, columns are available for two latch variables. You can add more columns from the context menu which will be available in the Data type property for column configuration of the Alarm Table and Alarm Banner visualization elements. Hint: You can configure the alarm visualization in such as way that displayed alarms are filtered by the contents of the latch variables. For more information, see: Using Latch Variables to Filter Alarm EventsHigher Prio. Alarm When the alarm is triggered, it can be acknowledged by triggering another alarm. For example, a temperature monitor should issue a warning at Temp > 60 °C and an error at Temp > 90 °C . If the temperature rises, then the warning is displayed starting at 60°C. As of 90°C, the alarm is triggered for the error. This alarm automatically acknowledges the 60°C warning. Messages are not saved as a copy in the history. Effect: If you make a small change to a message (for example, correcting a typing error), then this change has an effect on the history because the corrected message is now displayed there. However, if you completely reconfigure the alarm (change state or condition and update the message), then all previous alarms which were recorded due to the outdated configuration will get the new message in the history. Check on a case-by-case basis whether it is not better to add a new alarm instead of upgrading the outdated alarm. Observation type: Digital Digital Alarm condition for observing a Boolean variable Expression Expression for comparisons of = or <> If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. Example: (PLC_PRG.xVariable) = (PLC_PRG.xSpecified) The variable to be checked is on the left. The specified value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Observation type: Upper limit Upper limit Alarm condition for observing an upper limit Example: PLC_PRG.iX >= g_iUpperLimit Expression Expression for comparisons of > or >= If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The variable to be observed is on the left. The upper limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant for the operands. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Limit value Absolute upper limit with fixed values Variable Example: g_iUpperLimit Literal Example: 10 Relative upper limit using an expression Example: 0.9 * g_rUpperLimit The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value. Relative means that the limit value depends on an expression. Hysteresis in % Optional Deviation from the limit value where the alarm condition is reset ( FALSE ). The alarm condition is fulfilled as long as the upper limit value minus the deviation is exceeded. The size of the deviation is specified as a percentage (%) of the limit value. Example: Expression : i_temp >= 30 Hysteresis : 10% If the variable i_temp reaches or exceeds the value 30, then the alarm becomes active. The alarm is deactivated when the value falls below 27. Observation type: Lower limit Lower limit Alarm condition for observing a variable for a lower limit Expression Expression for comparisons of < or <= If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The project variable to be observed is on the left. The lower limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant for the operands. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Limit value Absolute lower limit with fixed values Variable Example: PLC_PRG.iX < g_iLowerLimit Literal Example: PLC_PRG.iX < 100 Relative limit value using expressions Example: PLC_PRG.rX < 0.9 * g_rLowerLimit The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value. Relative means that the limit value depends on an expression. Hysteresis in % Optional Deviation from the limit value where the alarm condition is reset ( FALSE ). The alarm condition is fulfilled as long as the value falls below the lower limit value plus the deviation. The size of the deviation is specified as a percentage (%) of the limit value. Example: Expression : i_temp < 10 Hysteresis : 10% If the variable i_temp falls below the value 5, then the alarm becomes active. The alarm is deactivated when the value rises above 11. Observation type: Outside range Outside range Alarm condition for observing a variable outside of a range Expression Expression if the variable to be observed falls below or exceeds the range. If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The button opens the Input Assistant for the variable to be observed. Area The upper limit value is on the left. The variable to be observed is displayed in the center field. The lower limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant. Between them, select the desired comparison operators from those available. The left field defines an expression for the lower limit of this range. The right field defines an expression for the upper limit. The expression to be observed is displayed in the field in-between. You need to set the comparison operators accordingly. The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value.

Specification of the priority of the alarm class (0–255). The prioritization of alarms should make sure that all alarms can be structured accordingly. Archiving : Alarms of this class are archived. An alarm of this class is archived when it is triggered at runtime and is displayed in the alarm table. Note: In order for archiving to happen, the Alarm Storage object must exist and be configured below the alarm configuration. Acknowledgement Acknowledgement method The visualization user must acknowledge the alarm in order for the alarm to be removed from the alarm list. When you move the mouse pointer over the possible acknowledgment methods in the expanded list box in the editor, the respective state transition chart is displayed on the right side. Acknowledgement method: ACK The alarm becomes inactive after acknowledgement. This is the acknowledgment method for Events . State transition chart: State transition chart when the Acknowledge instead of confirm option is selected: Acknowledgement method: REP The alarm is inactive after the cause is resolved. State transition chart: Acknowledgement method: REP_ACK The alarm is inactive after the cause has been resolved and acknowledgement. State transition chart: State transition chart when the Acknowledge instead of confirm option is selected: Acknowledgement method: ACK_REP The alarm is inactive after acknowledgement and the cause has been resolved. State transition chart: State transition chart when the Acknowledge instead of confirm option is selected: Acknowledgement method: ACK_REP_ACK The alarm is active. After the optional acknowledgement that the alarm has been received, the alarm becomes inactive. The cause must then be resolved and the end of the alarm event acknowledged. State transition chart: State transition chart when the Acknowledge instead of confirm option is selected: State transition chart Alarm states Normal : No alarm situation exists. No alarm has been triggered (normal state). Active Active : An alarm situation has occurred. Waiting for confirm. The alarm is inactive, but the acknowledgement with \"Confirm\" (for resolving the cause of the alarm event) has not yet been given. The system is still waiting for it. Inactive, Unacknowledged Waiting for confirmation : An alarm no longer exists; a confirmation has not been received yet. Inactive, not acknowledged The alarm has been triggered and exists. The acknowledgement (for ending the alarm) has already been given. State transitions activate The alarm event occurs and triggers an alarm. The alarm is active (\"alarm coming\"). deactivate An alarm is ending (\"alarm going\"). confirm The acknowledgement is given that the cause of the alarm event has been resolved for an alarm that is already inactive. ACK The acknowledgement is given that an alarm should be ended. Re-Alarm The alarm is reactivated. The alarm event has not been resolved (and its resolution has not been acknowledged). Acknowledge separately : In runtime mode, the visualization user cannot acknowledge the alarm together with other alarms, but must acknowledge it separately. This prevents the visualization user from accidentally acknowledging an alarm together with other alarms. Reset digital alarms automatically : Boolean variables which have triggered an alarm (of observation type \"Digital\") are automatically reset upon acknowledgement. Acknowledge instead of confirm : Compliant with OPC UA (without \"confirm\") Re-Alarm time Time literal which specifies the length of time after which an acknowledged alarm is reactivated if the alarm event is still active. For acknowledgement methods ACK_REP and ACJ_REP_ACK . The typical duration for this is 30 minutes. Example: t#30m Notification Actions List of notification actions Hint: When you select an action in the list, details are displayed in a separate window below this list. The details vary depending on the type of action. Action The configured action is executed on transition from one state to the other. Hint: To select one of the following action types, double-click in the column. Action: Variable The Variable action is done during the state transition. The variable is set to the configured value. This allows you to react programmatically to the state transition. Action: Execute The Execute action is done during the state transition. The specified program is executed. Action: Call The Call action is done during the state transition. The specified function block instance is called. State transition: Activate : The action is executed with \" Activate \" when the transition to the \" Active \" state is done. The available state transitions depend on the selected Acknowledgement method . At least one alarm state transition must be selected. State transition: Deactivate : The action is done with \" Deactivate \" when switching to the\" Normal \" state. State transition: Confirm : The action is executed with \" Confirm \" when the transition to the \" Normal \" state is done. State transition: ACK : The action is executed with \" ACK \" when the transition to the \" Active, Acknowledged \" state is done. Details Displays a summary of the action definition. The definition itself is displayed below the table. Edit the action there. Variable for Deactivation Variable via which an application can deactivate the action. Action type: Variable Requirement: An action with type Variable is selected. The details vary depending on the action type of the action selected in the Acknowledgement actions window as follows. Variable Variable (IEC application variable) Serves as a control variable (flag) to call an action code programmatically Right field Literal, variable, or expression You can select the variables via the Input Assistant. In the case of Boolean variables you can use the placeholder ALARM , in the case of integer variables the placeholder STATE . In the case of string variables, you can specify any IEC string literal (example: 'too high!' ). Placeholder: ALARM State ( TRUE or FALSE ) of the alarm of this alarm class which was last activated\/deactivated Placeholder: STATE The placeholder contains the currently reached alarm state of this alarm class (when the application is running). 0: Normal 2: Active 3: WaitingForConfirmation 4: ActiveAcknowledged Action type: Execute Requirement: An action with type Execute is selected. The details vary depending on the action type of the action selected in the Acknowledgement actions window as follows. Executable file Path and file name of the executable file on the controller. Parameter One or more parameters that you add to the call. You separate multiple parameters by a space. Action type: Call Requirement: An action with type Call is selected. The details vary depending on the action type of the action selected in the Acknowledgement actions window as follows. Function block instance Function block that is called. The function block must implement the IAlarmNotifiable interface ( AlarmManager.library ). The desired action on a change of state is implemented in the Execute method. Additional parameter structure If the function block requires an additional parameter structure, the structure members are listed on this table and can be filled here. An additional parameter structure is defined in the function block with the attribute AlarmManagerAdditionalData . Example: The function block has the following attribute. {attribute 'AlarmManagerAdditionalData' := 'StructEmailParams'} The structure employed must consist of scalar components or components of the type POINTER TO . Note: The ARRAY OF data types or custom data types are not supported. Note: Using the {attribute 'AlarmManagerMandatoryParameter'} attribute you can identify structure members as required parameters. Display Options for Alarm Table\/Alarm Banner Configures how the different states of an alarm are displayed in the alarm visualization element (alarm table or alarm banner). State Alarm state whose display is configured The available states depend on the selected Acknowledgement method . Font The default dialog for the selection of a font or color is opened with the button. Background color Background color for the alarm state Bitmap Icon for the alarm state You can add a bitmap by entering the bitmap ID. If no image file is assigned to this ID yet, the standard file search dialog opens. After having selected a file, the bitmap definition of the image pool GlobalImagePool is added.

You can also select an existing text list here. Archiving Selection of the alarm storage object for the alarm group Alarm storage is automatically activated when an alarm storage object is specified. Deactivation Boolean variable which deactivates all alarms in this group These alarms are no longer triggered, even if the alarm condition is fulfilled. Alarms which are already active are not affected. Show Alarm Instances : Generated alarm instances are displayed. Alarm Table Specify the properties of the individual alarms in the corresponding columns of the table. Depending on the selected observation type, input fields for additional required parameters are available below the table. ID Unique ID which corresponds to an ID in the associated text list You can change the ID in the ID field of the table. The ID must always be unique within the alarm group. Important: A change of the ID in the alarm table also directly causes a change in the text list, and the other way around. Observation Type Observation type selected from the list box Depending on the type, various input fields are available below the alarm table to define the alarm condition and help you configure the alarm condition. See the following tables for the individual observation types: Digital , Upper limit , Lower limit , Outside range , Inside the range , Change , Event (API) , Alarm (API) Details Alarm condition The details for the observation type (configured in the fields below the table) define the conditions under which the alarm is triggered. You can also specify the condition directly into the field. If you input an expression that does not match the currently selected observation type, the type is automatically adapted. Deactivation Optional Variable for deactivating the alarm Class Assigned alarm class Message Required Entry of a message text (message), which can contain placeholders for information from latch variables ( placeholders for data from a latch variable ) and can be supplemented with line breaks ( Ctrl + Enter ). The text entered here is automatically entered in the text list of the alarm group. When an alarm is triggered, this message is displayed in the alarm elements ( Alarm Table, Alarm Banner) . On-Delay Time Time for switch-on delay Defines the minimum time that the alarm condition must be fulfilled before the alarm is triggered. This can be used to suppress brief alarm events. Example: T#2s IEC 61131-compliant format (example: T#2ms). Off-Delay Time Time for switch-off delay Defines the minimum time that the alarm condition must be inactive before an alarm is treated as inactive. This can be used in the same way as the switch-on delay to ignore short-term value changes. Example: T#4s Latch Var 1 Latch Var 2 Variable with scalar type (8 bytes), STRING or WSTRING Latch variables are used to record additional values when an alarm is active. This makes it possible to provide additional information about the alarm. For example, when observing a motor speed, the temperature and the current are also recorded. By default, columns are available for two latch variables. You can add more columns from the context menu which will be available in the Data type property for column configuration of the Alarm Table and Alarm Banner visualization elements. Hint: You can configure the alarm visualization in such as way that displayed alarms are filtered by the contents of the latch variables. For more information, see: Using Latch Variables to Filter Alarm EventsHigher Prio. Alarm When the alarm is triggered, it can be acknowledged by triggering another alarm. For example, a temperature monitor should issue a warning at Temp > 60 °C and an error at Temp > 90 °C . If the temperature rises, then the warning is displayed starting at 60°C. As of 90°C, the alarm is triggered for the error. This alarm automatically acknowledges the 60°C warning. Messages are not saved as a copy in the history. Effect: If you make a small change to a message (for example, correcting a typing error), then this change has an effect on the history because the corrected message is now displayed there. However, if you completely reconfigure the alarm (change state or condition and update the message), then all previous alarms which were recorded due to the outdated configuration will get the new message in the history. Check on a case-by-case basis whether it is not better to add a new alarm instead of upgrading the outdated alarm. Observation type: Digital Digital Alarm condition for observing a Boolean variable Expression Expression for comparisons of = or <> If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. Example: (PLC_PRG.xVariable) = (PLC_PRG.xSpecified) The variable to be checked is on the left. The specified value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Observation type: Upper limit Upper limit Alarm condition for observing an upper limit Example: PLC_PRG.iX >= g_iUpperLimit Expression Expression for comparisons of > or >= Indicates whether the variable has reached or exceeded the upper limit. If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The variable to be observed is on the left. The upper limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant for the operands. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Limit value Absolute upper limit with fixed values Variable Example: g_iUpperLimit Literal Example: 10 Relative upper limit using an expression Example: 0.9 * g_rUpperLimit The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value. Relative means that the limit value depends on an expression. Hysteresis in % Optional Deviation from the limit value where the alarm condition is reset ( FALSE ). The alarm condition is fulfilled as long as the upper limit value minus the deviation is exceeded. The size of the deviation is specified as a percentage (%) of the limit value. Example: Expression : i_temp >= 30 Hysteresis : 10% If the variable i_temp reaches or exceeds the value 30, then the alarm becomes active. The alarm is deactivated when the value falls below 27. Observation type: Lower limit Lower limit Alarm condition for observing a variable for a lower limit Expression Expression for comparisons of < or <= Indicates whether the variable has reached or fallen below the lower limit. If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The project variable to be observed is on the left. The lower limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant for the operands. In the center input field, you can select the desired comparison operator from those available. Limit value Absolute lower limit with fixed values Variable Example: PLC_PRG.iX < g_iLowerLimit Literal Example: PLC_PRG.iX < 100 Relative limit value using expressions Example: PLC_PRG.rX < 0.9 * g_rLowerLimit The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value. Relative means that the limit value depends on an expression. Hysteresis in % Optional Deviation from the limit value where the alarm condition is reset ( FALSE ). The alarm condition is fulfilled as long as the value falls below the lower limit value plus the deviation. The size of the deviation is specified as a percentage (%) of the limit value. Example: Expression : i_temp < 10 Hysteresis : 10% If the variable i_temp falls below the value 5, then the alarm becomes active. The alarm is deactivated when the value rises above 11. Observation type: Outside range Outside range Alarm condition for observing a variable outside of a range. Indicates whether the variable reaches, falls below, or exceeds the valid range. Expression Expression if the variable to be observed falls below or exceeds the valid range. If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The button opens the Input Assistant for the variable to be observed. Area The upper limit value is on the left. The variable to be observed is displayed in the center field. The lower limit value is on the right. The button opens the Input Assistant. Between them, select the desired comparison operators from those available. The left field defines an expression for the lower limit of this range. The right field defines an expression for the upper limit. The expression to be observed is displayed in the field in-between. You need to set the comparison operators accordingly. The limit value can be specified as absolute or relative. Absolute means that the limit value is defined by a fixed value or a variable that returns a fixed value. Relative means that the limit value depends on an expression. Hysteresis in % Optional Difference from the limit values (in %) where the alarm condition is reset ( FALSE ) The alarm condition is fulfilled as long as the limit values only deviate by the difference. The size of the deviation is specified as a percentage (%) of the limit value. Observation type: Inside the range Inside the range Alarm condition for observing a variable inside a range. The alarm is triggered when the variable to be observed is within a range. Expression Expression when the variable to be observed is within the specified range If the expression is TRUE , then the alarm is triggered. The button opens the Input Assistant for the variable to be observed. Area The lower limit value is on the left. The variable to be observed is displayed in the center field. The upper limit value is on the right. Between them, the desired comparison operators are selected from those available. The button opens the Input Assistant.

"body" : "Initial situation: In your network, you have multiple PLCs whose applications (in addition to controller programs) each have their own alarm management. In the applications, the alarm conditions are checked and alarms are triggered if applicable. The alarm information is recorded. These remote applications are running (green and marked [run] ). The following image shows an example of such a network. If you add alarms in an alarm group on a remote PLC without subsequently updating the HMI application, then incorrect or incomplete displayed alarm information may be transmitted. This also happens when you add alarm classes or alarm groups on a remote PLC below an alarm configuration. Therefore, we recommend that you update the HMI application after changes are made in a remote alarm configuration. " },

We recommend using the copy of an ElementWrapper.js from the HTML5 examples as a template and adapting the name and functionality to your HTML5 control. For more information, see Example: HTML5-API You can integrate an HTML5 control which you have either developed yourself or taken from an external source into your CODESYS programming system. To do this, proceed as follows. Preparation Create a JavaScript file named ElementWrapper.js for your HTML5 control. Or copy an element wrapper file from the HTML5 API example (for example, the JS file of the HTML5DemoButton element). Rename the wrapper object in the JS file. The name is predefined and is made up of the element name with ElementWrapper added to it. The file name must always be ElementWrapper.js . And the wrapper object call up in it, which is generated by the framework at runtime, requires a name that is assigned to the element according to the following logic: <element name>ElementWrapper In the JS file for your element, the name of the wrapper object matches the new control. The following code fragment shows this for the HTML5DemoButton control: var HTML5DemoButtonElementWrapper;\nHTML5DemoButtonElementWrapper = function(idGenerator)\n… Specify all files which are required to run the element. These can be stylesheet files (CSS), JavaScript files (JS), or image files (SVG). Create an element image ( ElementImage.svg ). After installation, the element is displayed in the Visualization Toolbox view. Integration into the programming system Create an XML file ( .html5control.xml ) with general information. The HTML5 Control Editor helps you with this. The options of the HTML5 Control Editor are described in the chapter \" HTML5 Control Editor\". Create the mapping of the properties of the HTML5 control to the CODESYS visualization element properties. Localize the interface texts. Install the element. Sign the element.

The data of the element is displayed in the HTML5 Control Editor . Edit the element so that a valid description file is created: Configure the General tab: Company : Test GmbH Name : FirstControl The name must not contain spaces. Toolbox Category : Special Controls Optionally, specify an image file. If an image is not specified, then a default icon is used. Specify a JavaScript file (JS) as the element wrapper. This is unconditionally required. This file wraps the calls from the CODESYS framework with the calls to the control itself. If more files are required for the control, then these must also be specified here. These can be CSS files or JS files. You need to provide the wrapper file. Make sure that the ElementWrapper.js file is at the top and that the other files required for execution are below it. Example Optionally, on the Control Properties tab, configure the element interface. Optionally, on the Localization tab, configure the translations for the user interface texts of the control. Click Save and Install . Your settings are applied and their validity checked. Then the description file is saved and the control is installed in the repository. In the visualization element repository, the control is listed in Installed Elements . Using a control Open your CODESYS project. Open a visualization object. The recently installed control is available in the Visualization Toolbox view in the category which was specified in the description file. Drag the control to the visualization editor and select it.

Configuring the editor type means that the visualization developer gets support from an editor whose type you configure here when entering values. Control properties and column title  Column Input Option Description Property This column lists the hierarchically structured properties of the control. These consist of default properties, structuring nodes, and specific configurable properties.  Default Value This column lists the default values for the respective property. The default value must conform to the editor type set below. For example, if the editor type is a variable, then the default value must be type-compliant with this variable. The value can be specified as a literal or a variable. Property Type This column is used to set how the property behaves at runtime. Update The value is transferred only one time at the beginning. Initialize When the value changes, it is transferred to the HTML5 control. Variable Type This column lists the variable type configured for the respective property. Valid variable types are the data types available throughout the project (basic data types, custom data types, function blocks, and library blocks). Example: INT , PropertyNames.Colors Description ID This column lists the name of an entry on the \" Localization \" tab for the respective property. Editor Type This column lists the editor type configured for the respective property. This determines the inline editor which opens when the visualization developer clicks in the cell in the\" Properties \" view when configuring the HTML5 control in order to make an entry in the \" Value \" column. Note that both the default value and the variable type have to be configured type-compliant with the editor type. Variable Variable editor for the selection of a variable with the support of the SmartCoding functionality and the Input Assistant Color Color editor for selecting a style color or a custom color It is possible to use the color editor like a variable editor when a DWORD variable is entered. Font Font editor for selecting a style font or a custom font It is possible to use the font editor like a variable editor when a VisuElems.VisuStructFont variable is entered. Check Box Check box editor for selecting a Boolean value It is possible to switch the check box editor into a variable editor when a Boolean variable is entered. Image Image selection editor for assigning an image ArrayRange Editor for the assignment of an array segment In this case, only the scroll area is transferred to the control.

"body" : "A visualization style is a collection of colors, fonts, images, and any values that are defined as style properties. When designing a visualization element, you can use these style properties only. Then you have a uniform, style-dependent appearance. An element that applies style colors and style fonts behaves according to the selected style design in each selected style. In this way, a style property, such as Element basic color , can be blue In one style and gray in another style. In contrast, if the color of an element has a fixed value, this color is fixed even when the style is switched. All applicable styles are consistent because they define a fixed set of style properties. Therefore, you can switch smoothly between styles in order to customize your visualization. You can preview a style to get an impression of how it behaves. CODESYS provides different styles, for example the styles Flat style or White Style . These provided styles are installed in the Visualization Style Repository. If you do not like the available styles, then you can create your own. The easiest way to do this is to use an existing style as a base. For more information, see: Entries in the Visualization StyleThe selected style that applies to all visualizations in the application is set in the Visualization Manager object ( Settings tab, Style Settings group, Selected style ). In addition, the Properties view provides its style properties when designing an element. For each element, you can assign these styles instead of fixed values. The style is applied to all visualizations that are below an application. The settings of the Options – Visualization Styles dialog are also considered for a library visualization or a visualization in the POU view. " },
