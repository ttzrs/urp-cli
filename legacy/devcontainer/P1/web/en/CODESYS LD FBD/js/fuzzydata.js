"body" : "When the CODESYS LD FBD add-on is installed in your development environment, you can graphically create programming objects for controller applications in the LD or FBD languages according to IEC 61131-3. LD stands for Ladder Diagram . The programming language graphically represents the classic wiring of relays. FBD stands for Function Block Diagram . A programming block in FBD is also called a function block language (FBD). The graphical programming language allows for programming with boxes whose function is provided by the system, by own programming, or by libraries. Programming objects implemented in LD or FBD can be switched to the other programming language. Moreover, it is possible to switch to the now deprecated IL programming language. IL stands for Instruction List and is used for the logical linking of controller inputs and outputs. You can use the CODESYS Installer to update the CODESYS LD FBD add-on. IL can be enabled in the CODESYS options if required: In the FBD, LD and IL dialog, on the IL tab, select the Enable IL option. " },

The signal flow in the editor runs from top to bottom, starting with network 1. Example CFC is also a programming language based on the same principle as FBD, but with the following differences: The CFC editor is not network-oriented. You can freely place the elements in the CFC editor. Direct insertion of feedback paths is possible. The order of execution is determined by a list of currently inserted elements, which you can change. For more information, see the following: Programming in the Function Block Diagram (FBD)" },

"body" : "The ladder diagram (LD) is a graphically oriented programming language which is similar to an electrical circuit diagram. On the one hand, the ladder diagram is suitable for designing logical switching units, but on the other you can also create networks just as in FBD. Because of this, you can use LD very well for controlling calls of other program blocks. The ladder diagram consists of a series of networks. A network is bounded on the left side by a vertical line (bus bar). A network contains a circuit diagram of contacts, coils, optional boxes (POUs), and connecting lines. On the left side of a network, there is a contact or a series of contacts which relay the ON or OFF state, which corresponds to the Boolean values TRUE and FALSE , from left to right. A Boolean variable is associated with each contact. When this variable is TRUE , the status is relayed from left to right via the connection line. Otherwise OFF is relayed. As a result, the coil(s) in the right part of the network receive(s) the value ON or OFF coming from the left and the value TRUE or FALSE is written accordingly into the Boolean variable assigned to them. When the elements are connected in series, this means an AND operation. When they are connected in parallel, this means an OR operation. A line through an element means a negation of the element. The negation of an input or an output is indicated by a circle symbol. Example IEC 61131-3 defines a complete LD command set, consisting of different types of contacts and coils. Contacts conduct the current (according to their type) from left to right. Coils store the incoming value. Contacts and coils are assigned to Boolean variables. You can supplement an LD network with jumps, returns, labels, and comments. " },

"body" : "The instruction list is an assembler-like IEC 61131-compliant programming language. It supports accumulator-based programming. An instruction list (IL) consists of a series of instructions. Each instruction starts on a new line and contains an operator and one or more operands separated by commas, depending on the type of operation. A label followed by a colon can be placed in front of an instruction. It is used for the identification of the instruction and you can use the label as a jump destination. A comment must be the last element in a line. Empty lines can be inserted between instructions. All IEC 61131-3 operators are supported, as are multiple inputs, multiple outputs, negations, comments, set\/reset of outputs, and conditional\/unconditional jumps. Each instruction is based primarily on the loading of values into the accumulator ( LD instruction). After that, the corresponding operation is executed with the parameter from the accumulator. The result of the operation is written again into the accumulator, from where you should specifically store it with the help of an ST instruction. The instruction list supports comparison operators ( EQ, GT, LT, GE, LE, NE ) and jumps for programming of conditional executions or loops. Jumps can be unconditional ( JMP ) or conditional ( JMPC \/ JMPCN ). In the case of conditional jumps, a check is performed as to whether the value in the accumulator is TRUE or FALSE . Example " },

Alternatively, you could also use the commands of the context menu or the FBD\/LD\/IL menu. Settings for the display and interface are defined in the   CODESYS -Options, Category FBD, LD and IL. When you drag an element over a network in the editor, all possible insertion points are displayed with gray diamond-shaped, triangular, or arrow-shaped position marks. As soon as the mouse pointer is hovered over one of these marks, the mark turns green. Now when the mouse button is released, CODESYS inserts the element at this position. Example When you drag a function block or an operator from the ToolBox or a network at the left side of the network onto one of the two arrows, CODESYS automatically creates a new network and inserts the element there. To replace an element, drag a suitable other element onto its position. Elements which you can replace by the new element are indicated by CODESYS in the editor with text fields (example: Replace , Attach input ). You can use the usual commands in the Edit menu to cut, copy, paste, and delete elements. Copying also works by dragging and dropping while holding down the Ctrl key. The operators with EN\/ENO functionality can only be inserted in the FBD\/IL editor. Selecting elements A box or a connecting line in the editor is selected by clicking it so that it is in focus. Multiselection is possible by holding down the Ctrl key. A selected element is shaded in red. Tooltip When the cursor points to specific elements (for example, to a variable or to an input), a tooltip displays information about this element. In the case of elements underlined with a wavy red line, the tooltip shows the precompile error message of the error which occurs with this element. Navigating in the editor Using the keys and commands described below, you can set the focus within the editor on a different cursor position. The switch between the positions also works across the entire network. Switch to the adjacent cursor position, along the signal flow (from left to right, and right to left) ↑ ↓ Switch to the next cursor position above or below the current position, if this adjacent position belongs to the same logical group For example, all connections of a box form a logical group. If such a logical group does not exist: change to the first cursor position in the next higher or lower adjacent element.

In this case, the value at the input of the function block is sent directly to the output. If CODESYS determines FALSE for the SCE condition, then the box is called and the Boolean result of its processing is passed on. If all branches contain function blocks, then they are analyzed from top to bottom and their outputs are logically ORed. If there are no branches with function blocks, then normal OR operations are performed. Example The function block instance x1 (TON) has a Boolean input and a Boolean output. The execution of x1 is skipped if TRUE is determined for the condition in the parallel branch. The condition value results from the OR and AND operations which connect the contacts cond1 , cond2 , and cond3 . x1 is executed if the condition value from the connection of the contacts cond1 , cond2 , and cond3 is FALSE. (1) Indicates from the double vertical connections that it is a construct subject to an SCE. (2) Indicates from the single vertical connections that it is an OR construct. The given LD example is displayed below as ST code. P_IN and P_OUT are the Boolean values at the input (split point) and output (reunification point) of the parallel branch. P_IN := b1 AND b2;\n\nIF ((P_IN AND cond1) AND (cond2 OR cond3)) THEN\n P_OUT := P_IN;\nELSE\n x1(IN := P_IN, PT := {p 10}t#2s);\n tElapsed := x1.ET;\n P_OUT := x1.Q;\nEND_IF\nbRes := P_OUT AND b3; For switching between an OR construct and an SCE, see also: Toggle Parallel Mode" },

You repeat the operator in consecutive rows. Variant 1: Variant 2: Complex operands For a complex operand, you enter the opening bracket ( in the first column. You enter the closing bracket in the first column in a separate row following the operand entries of the following rows. A string is rotated by one character each cycle. Function block call, program call Column 1: CAL operator or CALC operator Column 2: Name of the function block instance or program and opening bracket ( If no parameters follow, then the closing bracket ) is entered here. Rows to follow that: Column 1: Parameter name followed by := for input parameter or => for output parameter Column 2: Parameter value followed by a comma , if further parameters follow The closing bracket ) is input after the last parameter. As a limitation according to the IEC standard, complex expressions cannot be used here. You need to assign such constructs to the function block or the program before the call. Function call Line 1: Column 1: LD Column 2: Input variable Line 2: Column 1: Function name Column 2: Further input parameters separated by comma CODESYS writes the return value into the accumulator. Line 3: Column 1: ST Column 2: Variable into which the return value is written Action call Like function block call or program call. The action name is appended to the name of the FB instance or the program. Jump Column 1: JMP operator or JMPC operator Column 2: Name of the jump label of the destination network In the case of an unconditional jump, the preceding instruction sequence must end with one of the following commands: ST , STN , S , R , CAL , RET , JMP In the case of a conditional jump the execution of the jump depends on the loaded value.
