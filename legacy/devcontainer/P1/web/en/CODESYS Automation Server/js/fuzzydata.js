The Add initial admin account dialog of the CODESYS Automation Server opens. Your ticket ID is also displayed in the dialog. In the Add initial admin account dialog, type in your Name , User name , email address, and a secure, unique password. The password has to meet the following requirements: At least 8 characters long At least 6 different characters At least one number (0–9) At least one uppercase letter At least one lowercase letter Then click the Create initial administrator button. The message Initial administrator account was created and the URL for logging in to the server are displayed in the next window. Copy this URL to the desktop of your computer, for example, because this URL accesses the sign-in page of your Automation Server. You will also need your email address and password to connect from the CODESYS Development System to your Automation Server. Copy this URL and paste it into your browser. Now you can sign in to your server on the Sign in page with your user name and the password you specified in the previous step. Then, according to the instructions in this help, you can enter PLC on the CODESYS Automation Server and connect the server to them. Using the CODESYS Automation Server Connector package, you can now add an Edge Gateway from the CODESYS Development System to the server and upload CODESYS projects and boot applications to the CODESYS Automation Server .

Restrict the accessibility of the gateway: Normally, the gateway is accessible on every IP address of the computer. To enable a secure configuration, it may be necessary for the gateway to be accessible only under one specific IP address.

To enable a secure configuration, it makes sense that the gateway only allows connections from specific clients, depending on the network configuration. This can be done by means of the following setting: [CmpGwCommDrvTcp] PeerAddress=<IP address or network base address> There are three different configuration options for this: The setting is not available: The gateway allows connections from all clients. The setting is assigned to a specific IP address: The gateway only allows connections from the client that has this IP address.

Open the List View view in the CODESYS Automation Server and click the desired PLC in the PLC list. The PLC Details view opens. Open the Configuration tab. Click the Test Encrypted Connection button. The Test Encrypted Connection dialog opens and shows whether an encrypted connection between the Edge Gateway and the PLC is possible: : Encrypted connection cannot be established between the Edge Gateway and the PLC. : Encrypted connection can be established between the Edge Gateway and the PLC. The following is required for an encrypted connection to be possible: The PLC has a certificate for encrypted communication. The certificate is also located in the \"Trusted\" folder of the Edge Gateway. If an encrypted connection is possible, then enable the Encrypted communication option and then click on Save Configuration button. Communication between the Edge Gateway and the PLC is now encrypted. No additional steps are required. If an encrypted connection between the Edge Gateway and the PLC is not possible, then perform the following steps: In order for communication to be encrypted between the Edge Gateway and the PLC, the Edge Gateway must trust the certificate with the \"Encrypted Communication\" use case of the PLC. If the certificate of the PLC with the \"Encrypted Communication\" use case is signed by a CA (Certificate Authority), then the CA certificate can also be copied to the Edge Gateway instead of the certificate of the PLC. In the following steps, the Quick Setup command is used to copy the certificate with the \"Encrypted Communication\" use case of the PLC to the Edge Gateway. Alternatively, the certificate could also be copied manually. Click the Quick Setup button. The Encrypted Communication Quick Setup dialog opens and displays the PLCs which are currently connected to the CODESYS Automation Server and running. Click the Prepare Certificates button. The PLC searches for a certificate for encrypted communication. If no corresponding valid certificate is found, then a new certificate is generated.

In the next step, select the Project , Commit , and Application of the commit. The available PLCs are displayed in the table located below. In the displayed list, select the PLCs where the application should be deployed. If you want a new version of an application to be deployed on the PLC as soon as it has been transferred to the Automation Server , then enable the Trigger on commit option. If you want the application of a specific commit to be deployed at a certain time on one or more PLCs, then select an Update time . To do this, click the icon ( ) and then select a date and time. Under Rollback on failure , select the desired action for the case that the deployment of the application on the PLC should fail. If a rollback should be performed in this case, then it means that the state on the PLC which was last configured on the Automation Server is restored. Select a Schedule status . The default setting is Active . Finally, click the Save button. The schedule which has just been created is listed in the Schedules view. When you click the button ( ) for your schedule, the settings will be displayed on the Schedule tab of the dialog. On the Logs tab, you can see the log entries for the schedule. " },

Restriction 2 Cause : Due to changes to the location of the CODESYS Edge Gateway configuration file, incompatibilities occur between the CODESYS Edge Gateway and CODESYS add-on (command in CODESYS : Tools → Update Edge Gateway or command in CODESYS : Tools → Deploy Control SL ). Workarounds : Compatible versions must be used to activate the configuration mode: CODESYS add-on >= 4.12.0.0 not compatible with CODESYS Edge Gateway for Linux < 4.12.0.0 CODESYS -add-on < 4.12.0.0 not compatible with CODESYS Edge Gateway for Linux >= 4.12.0.0 Restriction 3 Cause : The connection of the Edge Gateway with the CODESYS Automation Server can no longer be terminated with the CODESYS Automation Server Connector or the CODESYS Service Tool . Affected versions : CODESYS version >= 3.5.21.30 Workaround : Delete the connection information from the configuration file Gateway.cfg .The configuration file Gateway.cfg is located in the installation directory of CODESYS . In the configuration file, all entries in the section CmpEdgeGateway must be deleted.

For details, see CODESYS Security Advisory 2024-02 . As a result, the configuration mode for the CODESYS Edge Gateway can no longer be activated via the notification panel ( system tray ). Workaround : Manual activation of the configuration mode in the configuration file Stop the CODESYS Gateway V3 service. Enter the following setting in the Gateway.cfg configuration file under the section [CmpEdgeGateway] : MaintenanceMode=1 . Location of the configuration file: 64-bit CODESYS Edge Gateway : C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Roaming\\CODESYS\\CODESYSGatewayV3\\<checksum; newest folder for the newest edge gateway installation>\\ 32-bit CODESYS Edge Gateway : C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Roaming\\CODESYS\\CODESYSGatewayV3\\<checksum; newest folder for the newest edge gateway installation>\\ The path can only be accessed via Windows Explorer with the appropriate administrator permissions. This may require manually navigating to the corresponding folder instead of entering the path via copy and paste. Restart the CODESYS Gateway V3 service. In this mode, a connection between the CODESYS Edge Gateway and the CODESYS Automation Server can be configured using the CODESYS Automation Server Connector . Use this mode only within a secure environment. This mode is deactivated after 30 minutes when the CODESYS Edge Gateway is restarted or after the configuration has been completed. Restriction 2 Cause : The connection of the Edge Gateway with the CODESYS Automation Server can no longer be terminated with the CODESYS Automation Server Connector or the CODESYS Service Tool .
