"body" : "CODESYS Profiler is a program analysis tool which is integrated in CODESYS for detecting inefficient programming in your application source code. The term \" profiling \" means taking measurements for the runtime behavior of POUs of the application. This is possible by means of the instrumentation of the code , or on multicore systems by means of sampling . In addition to profiling, CODESYS Profiler also supports the measurement of code coverage . It determines the portion of the running statements for each POU. This method also works by instrumenting the code. You can use the measurement data to help plan a course of action for optimizing the source code on both a structural and algorithmic level. Overview of the integration of CODESYS Profiler in CODESYS : Insert a Profiler object below the application. In the editor of this object, configure the desired measurement method and view the measurement results in online mode. Moreover, in the Online → Profiler menu, the Profiler Watch List is provided for configuring and displaying the POUs to be measured. " },

POUs from libraries are also measured and the results displayed on the Online tab of the Profiler editor and in the Profiler Watch List view. However, no call trees are displayed for objects from compiled libraries. CODESYS Profiler provides different profiling methods for determining the processing times of programs for various kinds of problems. Profiling by instrumentation: Profiler measures the task runtimes directly by using additional code which is generated into the program. The recording and processing of the measured values takes place on the controller and therefore can also be performed without connecting the development system to the controller (in contrast to the other measuring methods). For more information, see: Profiling by Code Instrumentation Profiling by sampling (for multicore systems only): An additionally generated profiler task interrupts the task to be measured at random times and determines its current call tree. Runtimes of the POUs are calculated from these measurements and not measured directly. The method is not suitable for determining outliers of task runtimes, but rather for determining over a longer period of time which POUs take a particularly large amount of time. For more information, see: Profiling by Sampling Profiler watch list: Profiler measures the execution time of individual POUs by means of execution points which are set in the POUs while the program is running. For more information, see: Using the Profiler Watch List See the help pages for each method to find the right one for your application. " },

"body" : "The implicitly added IEC code for a Profiler measurement method, as well as the breakpoints for POUs in the watch list, result in a change and slows down the evaluated program. When a profiling or code coverage measurement is active, an online is generally not possible. Moreover, some online features are not available, such as \"flow control\" and \"breakpoints\". There are no restrictions for the watch list in this respect. Enabling or disabling a Profiler measurement method, or changing any settings in the Profiler editor each requires a download. Then an online change is no longer possible. There are no restrictions for the watch list in this respect. The recording and processing of the measured values takes place on the controller and therefore can also be performed without connecting the development system to the controller (in contrast to the other measuring methods). With this profiling method, CODESYS Profiler inserts additional code into the entry and exit of each function in the program. The runtimes of a entire task cycle are measured and stored. The method is useful for detecting individual outliers in the task runtimes. To do this, select the Record max cycle recording mode. When the entire project is instrumented, this can have a considerable impact on task runtimes and memory consumption. Therefore, select only a part of the application POUs for instrumentation whenever possible. One recommended approach is to first select only those POUs that are called directly by the task. Determine the \"hot spots\" of the runtime for these POUs and then based on these select the called POUs for measurement. POUs which are not selected for measurement are not shown on the measurement list, the call tree, or the backtrace tabs. Therefore, it is possible that a call tree \"POU1 -> POU3\" is displayed, although there is no direct call of POU3 by POU1. This is because there are POU calls which are not selected for measurement between POU1 and POU3. The \"own time\" output in the measurement for a POU can also contain times of called POUs which are not selected for measurement. Profiling activation and execution by means of instrumentation Requirement: A CODESYS project application with multiple POUs is open in offline mode. A task is defined to control POU calls. The application is the active application and can be compiled without errors. A connection to the standard controller is configured in the communication settings, and the controller is running. To activate and deactivate profiling programmatically, you define a Boolean variable in the application. (This is optional for the example described here. Activation can also be performed by a menu command.) Click Add Object to add a Profiler object below the application in the device tree. Double-click the object. The object editor opens. The Settings tab is in focus. Set the Method to Instrumentation . Select the Task with the POU calls that you want to perform time measurements on. Under Recording , select the task for controlling the POUs to be instrumented. For Condition , click the button and select the Boolean variable from your application that you want to use to switch the value recording on and off. Note: Using this kind of variable is optional. If you leave the field blank, then every cycle is recorded. Under Instrumentation parameters , set the Recording mode to Record next cycle . Leave the required Buffer size (the maximum number of POU calls that are recorded per task cycle) as the default 10000 . Under Snapshot appearance , select the Time format for displaying the recording. In POU selection , select the POUs that should be instrumented. Note that you could also select \"Instrument whole application\", which would include all POUs of the project as well as the POUs of the integrated libraries. Click Online → Login to download the application to the controller. The display is shown in the status bar of CODESYS . Click Online → Start to start the application. The project runs and you see the current variables values in the usual monitoring view. If you have configured a Boolean variable as a condition to start profiling, then now set this variable to TRUE . Background information about recording: Because you selected the Record next cycle option in this example, only the first cycle is recorded when the application is started and the profiling. No additional cycle is recorded. An additional measurement is performed only when a recording is uploaded from the controller. This uploading is done either by opening the Online tab for the first time or by clicking the Refresh snapshot button. For information about the alternative Record max cycle option, see the reference part of the help: 'Settings' Tab. Now look at the sampling results. Open the editor of the Profiler object and its Online tab. The Online tab provides four subtabs which can be selected from the menu on the left side. In addition, you see an area with buttons and settings for the profiling that is currently running. For more information, see: 'Online' Tab Detailed information about a POU call in the Properties dialog On the Online tab, click the Call Tree category. You see the hierarchy of all calls that have originated from the task specified in the Settings dialog. Select one of the calls and click Properties in the context menu. The Properties dialog for the called POU opens with detailed information, such as Own time and Standard deviation . " },

"body" : "When this method of measurement is activated, CODESYS generates an additional task. This task interrupts the application task to be measured at random times and determines its current call tree. Sampling is supported on multicore systems only. As the user, you have to assign the automatically generated profiling task to a separate task group in the task configuration. This task group should run on a different core than the application task to be measured. The recorded call trees of the task to be measured are transferred in cycles to the development system for processing. For that reason, this method works only when the development system is in online mode. Sampling is not suitable for determining outliers of task runtimes. Use the method when you want to determine over a longer period of time which functions take a lot of time and which ones take very little time. The result is a random collection over many task cycles. One-time effects in individual cycles cannot be detected. One advantage of this measurement method is that the influence on the task runtime is comparatively low and that the measurement can be switched on and off at any time at runtime. Activating and running the profiling operation by sampling Requirement: A CODESYS project application with multiple POUs is open in offline mode. The connection to a multicore controller is configured in the communication settings, and the controller is running. The Profiler task for sampling is running (ideally as a single task) on another core than the application task to be measured. In the task configuration, a \"Profiler\" task group is therefore created on its own core (ideally with the \"FixedPinned\" property). The automatically generated Profiler Task is the only one assigned to this group. The task group for the task of your IEC application to be measured is located on another core. The application is the active application and can be compiled without errors. In the application, you can create a Boolean variable that can be used to activate and deactivate profiling programmatically. This is optional. Profiling can also be switched on and off at runtime by clicking the Pause \/ Start button in the control panel of the Online view. Click Add Object to add a Profiler object below the application in the device tree. Double-click the object. The object editor opens. The Settings tab is in focus. Set the Method to Sampling . In the Recording group, select the Task of your application for whose POU calls you want to perform the time measurements. For Condition , click the button and select the Boolean variable from your application that you want to use to switch the value recording on and off. Note: Using this kind of variable is optional. If you leave the field blank, then every cycle is recorded. Configure the following settings in the Sampling parameters group: Profiler task group : Name of the task group that contains the automatically generated task for profiling (see above: requirements in the task configuration). Sampling interval : Time between the measurements (recommended: value of the task cycle time) Maximum depth of call stack that should be determined each time. Under Snapshot appearance , select the Time format for displaying the recording. Click Online → Login to download the application to the controller. The display is shown in the status bar of CODESYS Profiler . Click Online → Start to start the application. The project runs and you see the current variables values in the usual monitoring view. If you have configured a Boolean variable as a condition to start profiling, then now set this variable to TRUE . Now look at the sampling results. Open the editor of the Profiler object and its Online tab. Click the Refresh snapshot button and again after some time. You see the call tree of the task to be measured. For the individual blocks, the respective number of samples (measurements) and the determined total time that the block calls consume are displayed. " },

"body" : "The profiling task runs in an infinite loop and at high priority. At random times, the profiling task checks whether or not the application task to be measured is currently running. If it is running, then it is stopped and the current call tree is determined. The determined call tree is entered into a list (array). This list of call trees is transferred cyclically to the development system and processed there with the previous measurements. Therefore, sampling runs only as long as the development system is connected to the runtime. The sampling method is used to determine a statistical distribution of the execution of POUs. The runtimes displayed in the result view are not measured directly, but are the result of a calculation. The calculation is based on the assumption that POUs which are often found in the call tree also need a longer execution time. The portion of the measurements (samples) of a POU to the total number of samples is converted to the time portion of the POU call to the cycle time of the task. Example: In a task T1 , two programs P1 and P2 are called and the task cycle time is 20 ms. The Profiler task performs 100 samples and determines the following: T1 halts in the program P1 20 times. T1 halts in the program P2 50 times. T1 does not run 30 times. Then the Profiler detects the following times from the proportion of the task to the cycle time and displays it in the inline view: P1 : 4 ms P2 : 10 ms Idle : 6 ms The runtime of the task is obviously extended by a measurement. This increase is not constant, but depends on the depth of the call tree. Depending on the platform, an extension of the runtime in the range of 10 µs – 100 µs has to be expected, possibly even more. Measurements of the \"Failed Samples\" category: Errors can occur when determining the call tree. Possible error causes: The length of the array where the call tree is stored is too short. In this case, no call tree is determined at all. The user can change the length of the array in the Profiler settings ( Maximum depth of call stack ). The task is in an unfavorable state, for example in a \"lock\" because it is currently attempting to operate I\/Os (to access hardware). The measurement fails. The number of failed measurements is shown in the online view in the category Failed Samples : If the number of such failed measurements is very high despite a sufficiently long list (array) for the call tree, then you should try to resort to another measurement method. Measurements of the category IDLE : Measurements for which the task is currently not running are displayed in the online view in the IDLE category. Background: A cyclic task is usually configured with a shorter runtime than the cycle time is. As a result, there is a time period within the cycle in which the task does not run. Missing samples: Missing samples are measurement recordings on the controller that are not transferred to the development system. Due to a large call tree array (large required call tree depth) and\/or a high sampling rate (small Sampling interval ), it can happen that not all recorded call trees can be transferred to the development system. However, because lost measurements are distributed over the cycle in the same way as the measurements that are transmitted, the result is not corrupted. For this reason, the number of missing samples is displayed only in the Online – Overview view ( Number of missing samples ), not as a separate category in the result views (like the failed samples). But the number of lost samples indicates a possibly too high sampling density, which also unnecessarily increases the cycle time. In this case, you should modify either the settings accordingly for the Maximum depth of call stack or for the Sampling interval . " },

Then an online change is no longer possible. There are no restrictions for the watch list in this respect. In CODESYS , the Profiler Watch List is provided with CODESYS Profiler . In this view, you can combine a selection of POUs or POU instances whose runtimes and calls that you want Profiler to measure. The configuration is possible in both online mode and offline mode. When you select a POU for the Profiler Watch List, a watch point is set implicitly at the first and last break point position of the POU. The time difference between the two watch points on the controller is measured. In the case of a function block, the measurement is also performed and displayed for all POU instances. The Profiler Watch List can have a very different impact on the task runtime, depending on how often the implicitly set execution points are started. When a function block instance is entered in the watch list, the execution points for all instances of the corresponding function block are reached. However, time is measured only for the specified instance. The Profiler Watch List is suitable for measuring the runtime of individual POUs in runtime mode. The major advantage of this method is that it does not require any special code and it is always available. Configuring watch lists Requirement: A project exists with an application which calls different program and function blocks as well as function block instances. In this example, you configure the list in offline mode: Open the project and click Online → Profiler → Profiler Watch List . The empty Profiler Watch List opens. Drag one of the application POUs from the device tree to the watch list. The POU is inserted into the first line of the list. The POU column contains the POU name, and the Application column contains the name of the respective application. Add all additional required POUs, either by dragging them to the list or by double-clicking a field in the POU column to open the Input Assistant. Now view the list in online mode: Download the project to the controller and start it. Open the Profiler Watch List . You see measurement results about the call durations and number of calls for each POU. See the help page for the Profiler Watch List . Click Display Mode in the context menu of the watch list and change to another data type or unit. All current results in the list are displayed continuously in the selected format, as is the case for monitoring. Click Open POU in the context menu of the watch list. The POU currently in focus in the list is opened in the editor. You see the solid green circle of the watch point at the beginning and end of the implementation code that is implicitly set to enable the Profiler measurement. Drag another POU to the watch list. The POU is included immediately in the measurement. For more information, see: Using the Profiler Watch List " },

If the field is blank, then every cycle is recorded. Watch first cycle Available only when the profiling method is set to Instrumentation . The first cycle often has special tasks and therefore takes a particularly long time, but in most cases it is not interesting for the measurement. Therefore, it is excluded from the measurement by default. Instrumentation parameters Available only when the profiling method is set to Instrumentation .

An additional measurement is performed only after a recording is uploaded from the controller either by opening the Online tab for the first time, or by clicking Refresh snapshot . Record max cycle : Every cycle is recorded. The result of a recording is saved when the cycle has lasted longer than the last saved recording. When a recording is uploaded from the controller, the longest recording to date is deleted and the recording starts all over again. Buffer size : Maximum number of individual recordable run times per cycle. These are the runtimes of all POU calls for the task specified above. For a correct configuration of the buffer size, also note the selected Recording mode . Sampling parameters Available only when the profiling method is set to Sampling . For background information about these settings, see also the help page \"Profiling by Sampling\", \"Functionality of the measurement\" section. Profiler task group : Task group that contains the Profiler task. The list box shows the task groups available in your multicore system. Note: Make sure that the sampling task of the Profiler is on a different core than the task of the application to be measured. Optimal: No other task is running on the same core as the Profiler task. Sampling interval : Time period when a random measurement should be taken. Background: Within this period, sampling is performed at a random time. For this purpose, the task to be sampled is halted and the call tree is recorded. The remaining time of the specified interval elapses, and only then is the next random sampling time generated. At a sampling interval of 1 ms, 100 samples are performed in 100 ms. In general, no different results are obtained with a shorter interval than with a longer interval. It makes sense, for example, to specify the task cycle time as the sampling interval. Then the sampled task is interrupted no more than one time per cycle so that the influence of the sampling on the runtime is limited. Note: The value can also be modified in online mode in the Online view. Maximum depth of call stack : Number of levels of the nested call tree that are recorded in the samples. Selection between 20 and 100. This is the maximum nesting depth for which the call tree of the POU is determined during a measurement. Note: The greater the nesting depth to be recorded, the more extensive the individual measurement will be and the fewer measurements will fit into the memory that is reserved for this purpose. In this case, the Profiler task may fill the list of samples faster than this list can be transferred to the development system. This can cause samples to be lost, which will not corrupt the result, but will unnecessarily slow down the cycles. You should avoid this by reducing the sampling rate. Snapshot appearance Time format tick : Time unit defined by the processor. ms : Milliseconds µs : Microseconds ms\/µs : Milliseconds or microseconds (depending on size) Note: Implicit code calculates the approximate assignment of the time formats \"ms\" and \"µs\" to system ticks. On the Online tab, in the Profiler results category, you can see the calculated value displayed in the Time entry. Example: 1 ms = 3398810 ticks . Determining critical limits Critical limit total time Critical limit end of call chain Critical limit high own time Critical upper limits for the times measured in the current cycle. If the time of a call in the cycle exceeds the percentage defined here for the total cycle time, then this is indicated in the Profiler results with a symbol at the beginning of the respective lines. Total time: Time spent by the POU call, including all calls from this POU. End of the call chain: Last call in the call tree.

Online – Overview Tab General information about the recording Header Project path – Creation date and time (example: D:\\\\proj\\\\test1.project - 12\/26\/2014 09:28:14 ) Device Target device where the application is running (example: Device (XY Zxxx V2.1) ) Application Application for the measurement results (example: Device.Application_xy ) Compiler version Compiler version for the project (example: 3.5.6.0 ) Task Task selected in the settings (example: MainTask ) For instrumentation only: Number of instrumented POUs Number of POUs selected in the Profiler settings in POU selection Example: 5 Cycle Number of the current cycle, incremented at the start of recording Example: 2431 Duration Duration of all calls of the current recorded cycle Example: 266.318 µs Time Time format for the display of the results; internally calculated assignment to the system ticks; defined in the Profiler settings in Snapshot appearance Example: 1 ms = 3385266 ticks . Start time of the measured cycle Start time of the measurement Example: T#1h50m31s25ms Current time on device Time of day Example: T#4h10m38s47ms - 02\/08\/2019 11:13:50 Recording mode Recording mode; defined in the Profiler settings in Instrumentation parameters Example: Record next cycle Buffer size Buffer size for the number of recorded runtimes per cycle; defined in the Profiler settings in Instrumentation parameters Example: 10000 . For sampling only: Task cycle time Interval set for the task to be sampled in its configuration (example: 20 ms ) Number of cycles Total number of cycles where samples were taken Example: 3924 Number of sampled POUs Number of POUs called by the task to be sampled Example: 11 Total number of samples Total number of samples (determined call trees) Example: 2889 Number of busy samples Number of samples that the POU was currently busy with Example: 108 Number of idle samples Number of samples that the POU was currently busy with ( IDLE ) Example: 6533 Number of faulty samples Number of samples that failed ( failed ) Example: 4 Number of missing samples Number of samples that could not be transferred to the development system Example: 0 Busy cycle time Time span during the cycle in which the task is running (average value) Example: 283.000 µs Idle cycle time Time span during the cycle in which the task is not running (IDLE) (average value) Example: 19.716 ms Recording condition Condition (Boolean expression) for starting the recording; defined in the Profiler settings in Recording Online – Call Tree Tab This hierarchical tree structure shows all calls that have been made to the selected task during the measurement period. Calls in libraries are not displayed. The top entry shows the name of the task. In the second line, the percentage of samples in which the POU was not busy is shown for the method of sampling with IDLE . Each node in the call chain displayed below it corresponds to a specific POU call and provides the following information about the current and previous measured times and number of calls: For both instrumentation and sampling methods: Percentage of time that has elapsed in this call to the time that has elapsed in all calls (example: 34.05% ) Name and type of POU (example: PLC_PRG (PRG) ) For the instrumentation method only: Total time elapsed in the call (example: 85.531 µs ) Number of calls of the POU in this cycle in this call tree (example: 22 Calls ) Average, minimum, and maximum execution time of this call (example: Avg: 0.254 µs Min: 0.194 µs Max: 0.3µs ) For the sampling method only: Total number of previous samples for the POU (example: 22 samples ) Calculated previous total time elapsed in the call (example: 85.531 µs ) Example of a call tree for the instrumentation method: Example of a call tree for the sampling method: Online – List Tab All instrumented POUs are listed. For each POU, you see the number of Samples and the Time (ms\/µs) of all recorded calls. The Functions called by <POU name> list in the lower part of the view always shows the POU calls of the POU currently selected in the list above. Double-clicking a line in the lower list selects the corresponding entry in the upper list. POU Name Name and type of POU (example: PLC_PRG (PRG) ) Time (ms\/µs) Total time elapsed in the call (example: 85.531 µs ) Average time Min. time (ms\/µs) Max. time Average, minimum, and maximum execution time of this call in \"ms\" or \"µs\" (example: Avg: 0.254 µs, Min: 0.194 µs Max: 0.3µs ) Own Time (ms\/µs) Own Time (%) Time that the POU call has spent, excluding the time spent by all POU calls from this POU. Percentage of the own time to the total time Calls Number of calls of this POU in this cycle in this call tree (example: 22 Calls ) Standard deviation Standard deviation of the average execution time (example: 0.128 µs ) Example: Online – Back Traces Tab This is a reverse view of the call tree. This means that you can trace all calls from a POU call to the beginning of the call chain. The information shown depends on the profiling method. For both instrumentation and sampling methods: Percentage of own time to total time (example: 19.35% ) Name and type of POU (example: MID (FUN) ) For the instrumentation method only: Own time, or portion of the own time of the call to the own time of the node (example: 9.466µs of 9.752 µs ) Number of calls in this call tree in this cycle, and the percentage of calls to the total number of calls (example: 4 Calls of 5 ) For the sampling method only: Previous number of samples (example: 16 Samples ) Previously calculated call time for the POU (example: 375.000 µs ) Example: Actions for the current measurement Refresh snapshot The current measurements are done and displayed. The display is not refreshed automatically. Save Snapshot The Save Snapshot dialog opens for typing in a name and description for the snapshot. After you click OK , the current measurement results are saved and can be called again in the Snapshots tab. Reset For the sampling method only: The current measurement is reset and can be restarted. Start Pause For the sampling method only: Button for starting, pausing, and stopping, the measurement process Sampling interval For the sampling method only: Time period between measurements. The value of the interval set here is synchronized with the entry in the Profiler settings in Sampling parameters . A random value is generated in the range between 0 and the specified time span. After this time, the task to be measured is paused and recorded. The remaining time until the specified time span elapses until the next random value is generated. This means that it is measured within the time span, but not before the full time span has been reached. At a sampling interval of 1 ms, 100 measurements should be performed in 100 ms.
