"body" : "The implementation of CODESYS Git is based on the work in Git and on the terminology of Git. After the installation, the menu bar of CODESYS will include the Git menu with the commands to initialize a Git project and work with the linked Git repositories. See the following for some of the terminology used in the CODESYS Git help and in the CODESYS Git user interface. Corresponding standard Git commands are included. Basic knowledge of working with Git is a prerequisite. For documentation about this, see (for example): Git Book , Atlassian Git Bucket Git repository , Git project storage (\"working directory\", \"working tree\") For the purely local repository for a CODESYS Git project, we use the shortened term \"Git repository\" here. The Git repository is located in the file system, in the \"Git project storage\", in the subdirectory .git . The objects of the project ( <objecttype>_<ID> ) which are managed in Git are located in the subdirectory project . The object files are located in a directory hierarchy which corresponds to the hierarchy of objects in the CODESYS project. The Git project storage also contains the Git management files .gitattribute , .gitignore , and .apsession . The file .apsession is used to control the access of CODESYS instances to the Git repository and is ignored by Git. The path of the Git project storage of a project can be seen in the Git Project Settings view. The configuration settings, which are available in the .git\/config file, can be modified in a CODESYS Git project via a configuration dialog . If there is no global config file in the local user directory from previous Git actions, then the user is prompted to create a configuration when initializing or cloning a project. CODESYS Project directory A project which is managed with CODESYS Git is also always stored in an ordinary CODESYS project directory in addition to being stored in the Git project storage (double data management). Remote repository : View: Git Remotes git remote Make sure you have a secure connection to a remote server. For more information, see: Security for CODESYS Git Remote repositories are versions of your project which are hosted on the Internet or somewhere on your network. It is entirely possible that you can work with a \"remote\" repository which is actually located on the same computer (host) which you are currently working on. The remote repository is usually named origin . A CODESYS project which is already managed in Git in a local Git repository can be linked with a remote repository in the Git Remotes view ( git remote , git remote add ). Only after that can local branches \"track\" remote branches and can equivalent branches be created for local branches in the remote repository (\"upstream\"). And only after that can the Fetch , Pull , Push , and Merge commands be used for the exchange\/merge of commits between the local Git repository and the remote repository. To perform Git operations with a remote repository, credentials are usually required for authentication. These are saved in Windows in the Credential Manager. The same credentials can be used for all remote repositories located on the same host server. For more information, see: Credentials needed. Local branches, remote branches View: Git-Branches git remote git branch There are exactly two kinds of branches: \"local\" and \"remote\". A local branch can \"track\" exactly one remote branch. Local branches: Local branches are displayed in the Git Branches Local (<n>) view. The local default branch of a Git repository (usually master ) is created automatically after the first commit. After the CODESYS project has been created using git clone , the local \"master\" branch automatically tracks the remote branch of the same name. A local branch is also created by copying an existing local branch, or by checking out a remote branch. In the last case, the recently created local branch automatically tracks the remote branch. Remote branches: Remote branches are displayed in the Git Branches Remote (<n>) view. They are the existing representatives in the Git repository of the respective branch with the same name in the remote repository. Remote branches are used only internally as an \"intermediate location\" for communication via Push \/ Pull with the remote repository and are not used directly by the user. “ Upstream \" Command in the Git Branches Local view git branch --set-upstream-to <origin\/remote-branch> The Upstream Set action causes a branch, which corresponds to the local branch, to be created in the remote repository (remote branch). \" Tracking \", \"Remote tracking branches\" Command in the Git Branches view git branch --track git checkout Track branch means creating a link between a local branch and a remote branch. Default case: The local representative branch master of the Git repository tracks the remote branch origin\/master of the remote repository. When a local branch tracks a remote branch, an exchange of commits with the remote repository is possible by means of Pull and Push . Alternatively, you could also use the Checkout command in the Git Branches Remote (<n>) view to create a local \"tracking\" branch, which is set as \"current\" branch at the same time, for an existing remote branch. The current branch is the one where new commits arrive. Git index View: Git Status git status The index is a Git-internal intermediate level between the working directory and the Git repository. It allows for selectively marking only a selection of changed objects for a commit. Not all changes have to be checked in as a commit. Objects which are located in the Git index are visible in the Status & Staging view, in the Staged Changes section. Resynchronization and reloading the project Synchronization The CODESYS project in CODESYS is resynchronized with the current state from the Git project storage after each Git operation which performs a change to the Git repository. These operations include the following: Checkout , Pull , and Merge of branches ( Git Branches view) Discard all changes and Rollback all unstaged changes ( Status & Staging view) Changes by the resolution of conflicts The resynchronization of the CODESYS project has the effect the project is rebuilt completely from the repository. No attempt is made to update the project. You can use the Rebuild Project from Repository to explicitly initiate a resynchronization. Synchronization, on the other hand, is the application of changes from the CODESYS project storage to the Git project repository. This happens whenever a change is made in the CODESYS project. When changes are made to the project, exactly only those changes are applied. When the project is reopened, the complete project is applied to the Git project repository again and overwrites the state there. You can use the Synchronize project with Git project storage command (not in the Git menu by default) to explicitly initiate a synchronization. " },

For the collaboration with other developers on the project, the local Git repository can be linked with a \" remote repository \" which is accessible to everyone. Work on the project managed in Git is done first in local branches (work statuses). The local branches can track a remote branch (link to the remote repository). Remote branches are the existing representatives in the local Git repository of the respective branch in the remote repository. You can use the Move Repository command to move a Git repository to another location in the file system.

The Initialize Git Repository dialog opens. In the dialog, specify the path of the empty directory for the Git project storage (example: D:\\git_local\\rep1 ). The Git repository created there is your local \"master\". If there is no global configuration file .gitconfig in the local user directory (example: C:\\Users\\m.muster ), then a dialog prompt will open for you to create a basic configuration for all CODESYS Git actions. You get the same dialog for entering some parameters as via the Git Config command. The default setting for Default Branch is master . Enter your user data Username and Email address (example m.muster , m.muster@company.com ). The objects in the project navigator are provided with blue plus signs (status: \"added\"), and the root node (project name) is provided with an orange square (status: \"changed\"). The path of the Git project storage is displayed in the Git → Project Settings view. As a result, the project management in the Git repository located in the project storage is initialized. Save the project (as usual without Git management) in a separate project directory (example: D:\\git_projects\\myproj.project ). Note: The project files are therefore subject to double data management. Open the Git Status view. In Unstaged Changes in the lower part, select the displayed project objects. Then click the button to stage it for a commit. The objects are moved above to Staged Changes . Click the button (commit). In the Commit staged changes dialog, enter a commit message and click OK to confirm. The current status of the project objects is committed to the local repository. Click the Git → Git History command. In the History view, the first commit for the \"master\" is shown with more information. In the project navigator, solid green circle symbols are displayed in front of the committed objects and in front of the root. This means that the status of the project is in sync with its status in the Git repository. Click the Git → Git Branches command and enable the Local (1) filter. The default branch for the Git repository is visible as master (refs\/heads\/master) . In the file system, go to the local repository D:\\git_local\\rep1 .

In CODESYS Git version 1.4.0.0 and higher, a scripting interface will be available for transferring a project from CODESYS SVN to CODESYS Git .

Comments and recommendations due to the different repository structures of CODESYS SVN and CODESYS Git In CODESYS Git , a Git repository can manage only one CODESYS project. Because an SVN repository can contain multiple CODESYS projects, a separate Git repository has to be created for each project in an SVN repository when transferring to CODESYS Git . It is recommended to transfer the individual projects of an SVN repository to the repositories of CODESYS Git on a project-by-project basis. It is not recommended to split an SVN repository into multiple SVN repositories because this can cause problems later on. Branches and tags exist in both SVN and GIT, but they are designed differently in these two systems. A transfer with the git-svn command is not possible because this command cannot be used in CODESYS Git (see above). Therefore, we limit ourselves to transferring the SVN trunk to a Git branch (by default \"Master\" or \"Main\"). If necessary, the SVN tags can be added manually as Git tags. " },

"body" : "A merge operation merges the contents of two branches which have a common ancestor but have received different changes. Targeted merging of branches is mainly done in the Git Branches view using the Merge command. A merge operation is also included in a pull action. Different states of the source and target branches are detected during the merge operation and are called a conflict. An unpermitted project structure resulting from merging is identified as a \"relationship issue\". Depending on the set option, CODESYS Git tries to automatically resolve these conflicts whenever possible, or this resolution is left to the user. After the conflict is resolved, CODESYS Git always tries to Resynchronize (re-read the project from the project storage). This is done by closing the project which is open in CODESYS and creating a new one from the storage. CODESYS Git distinguishes between two types of problems to be resolved which can occur while merging: Conflicts : Pure Git conflicts: One or more objects received competing changes. It can be different changes in the contents of an object. The basic \"merge conflict strategy\" is set in the Git Merge Options in the Git Branches view. Depending on this setting, either an automatic conflict resolution runs whenever possible, a basic acceptance action is taken in a specific direction, or the conflicts are handled manually. In case of manual conflict resolution, the conflicting objects are displayed as such in the Status & Staging view. Double-clicking a conflicting object opens a comparison view. In the comparison view, the changes originating from the two branches are displayed side by side. You can clean up differences in the contents by specifically accepting them. If they are purely namespace conflicts, then you need to resolve them by renaming or deleting in the project tree. Click “Apply” to resolve the conflict. After that, the previously conflicted object is automatically moved to the “Staged Changes” area. “Relationship Issues\" : Competing changes have resulted in an invalid project structure in CODESYS , which cannot be handled by the Git merge function. Changes may have been made externally in the file system with external tools. Or a concurrent creation of an object of the same type and\/or the same name was committed from different branches, and this object is then located in the same namespace in the CODESYS project. This is not allowed in a CODESYS project. Or an invalid father\/child object relationship has occurred. Another possibility is that relationship issues originate from previous merges, where they were deliberately ignored in order to be able to continue working for the time being. For example, the situation happens that two alarm configurations are inserted below one device, which is not allowed. The user has to manually correct the project structure using the available means (merging one object into another, deleting, renaming, or moving) to get a consistent project again. As of version 1.2.0.0, a project can also be processed further with existing relationship issues (ignore). Attention: In such a case, changes to the project are discarded by a later resynchronization. Reason: The resynchronization operation loads the project version from the file system which was saved before the relationship issue was ignored. In the Status & Staging view, you as a user can check and edit a conflict as follows: Helpful commands are available in the context menu of a conflicting object. The current selection depends on the situation: Show all affected objects \/ Show this object : The objects or object will be highlighted in the Devices view of the project. Resolve using theirs : The state of the source branch is applied. Resolve using ours : The state of the target branch is applied. Resolve automatically : CODESYS Git tries to consolidate the changes itself. Mark as resolved : The object which currently exists in the project is applied and considered to be the resolution of the conflict. The corresponding object has been staged. Ignore Relationship Issue : The relationship issue is ignored until the next resynchronization. This can be useful when you only want to be able to continue working on a project and the conflict does not matter for this. Double-clicking a conflicting object opens the comparison view of source and target branch contents. In the case of competing contents, the contents can be applied from one branch to the other as you want. In the Messages view, you can double-click an error message for a conflict in order to open the affected object. " },

These can be branches which are already tracking a remote branch, or branches which exist purely locally and do not contain any link to a remote repository. Call : Git → Branches menu Requirement : At least one commit exists in the repository. The view is refreshed. Copy ( git copy ) Opens the Create New Branch dialog to create a new local branch as a copy of the currently selected local branch (see above) Delete ( git branch -D ) The selected branch is deleted, even if the branch has not yet been merged completely. Note: The current branch cannot be deleted. Checkout ( git checkout ) As a result of the Checkout operation, the selected branch becomes the current branch. This means that the Git operations act on the contents of this branch, which are loaded into the local Git repository (\"working directory\") for this purpose. A checkout is prevented by uncommitted changes. When dealing with a remote branch – an entry under Remote (<n>) – the following options are possible: A dialog opens with the message: This remote branch is already tracked by local \"master\" branch, which will be checked out instead. Branch name \"origin\/master\" . In this case, there is already a local remote branch (under Local (<n>) ) which tracks the currently selected remote branch and can therefore Pull and Push with it. Then this local branch is loaded into the working directory for editing. It is possible that the checkout is denied at first, because of inconsistencies caused by local changes made directly in the working directory. With the Force option, these inconsistencies can be accepted initially and the checkout can still be performed. Checking out this remote branch will create a corresponding local tracking branch. This name for the local branch is already used. The operation will most likely fail. In this case, there was not yet a local remote branch tracking the currently selected remote branch. CODESYS Git wants to create a local branch, but the name for it is already in use. With the Force option, the operation can still be forced. Attention: The existing branch will be overwritten by this. There was no local remote branch yet. No tracking. This branch is now created and set as \"current\" and tracking is activated. This means that work will continue immediately on this branch. Merge ( git merge ) Clicking the button will execute the command directly. Alternatively, you could also set options for it. To do this, use the arrow key to select the Merge with options command. The Merge Branch dialog opens where you can select the Options which is valid for the current merge action. Merging requires the name and email address of the user. This information is taken from the Git settings. If this is not possible, then a dialog prompt opens. The user name and email address can be changed in the Merge Branch dialog. When you confirm the request (dialog prompt) whether or not you really want to commit, the commits of the currently selected branch are committed to the current branch. The current branch is the one whose status is now in the working directory. (check mark in the Current column) If conflicts or relationship issues occur while merging, then they have to be resolved first. Depending on the case and the set merge options in the Branches view, automated actions will run or manual actions are necessary. If a conflict cannot be resolved automatically, then this is indicated in the Status & Staging view. For conflict resolution in the first step, pay attention to the context menu commands provided in the Status & Staging view. As long as the merge operation has not been completed, the status info Merging is displayed in the header of the view as well as in the taskbar. The Merge action requires the name and email address of the user. This information is taken from the Git Project Settings . If this is not possible, then a dialog prompt opens. Upstream: Set\/Clear git push -u origin local-branch git branch --set-upstream-to <origin\/remote-branch> Opens the Set upstream remote for Branch dialog Here a branch corresponding to the local branch is created and the link with it set up on the linked remote repository (usually named \"origin\" and located on a server, for example). Track branch git branch --track Opens the Track a remote branch dialog Here the local branch can be linked with an available representative of a remote repository (remote branch). This allows for an exchange of commits (Git operations Pull and Push ) between the local repository and remote repository. Pull ( git pull ) Pull with options The status of the tracked remote repository branch is fetched in the local branch ( git fetch ) and also merged with it ( git merge ). Requirement: The local branch tracks the remote branch of the remote repository. The Pull action requires the name and email address of the user. This information is taken from the credentials stored on the computer. If this is not possible, then they are queried again in the Git pull <remote branch> dialog. For more information about the credentials for a remote repository, see: Credentials neededThe Pull with options command explicitly opens this dialog so that settings can be edited. If the Remember me option is enabled for the Name and Email credentials, then the settings from the dialog are saved in the Git configuration file .git\/config in the local repository. Push ( git push ) If the selected branch is not a tracking branch, then the Push Branch dialog opens. Here you specify the remote branch to be merged into. The commits of the local branch are pushed to the corresponding branch in the remote repository. If the selected branch is a tracking branch, then the action is performed immediately. No dialog opens. Compare The selected branch is compared with the last state of the project in the project storage and the differences are displayed in the comparison view . When two branches are selected, they are compared. Filter branches: Local|Remote By clicking the Local (<n>) and\/or Remote (<n>) buttons, the display of local branches and\/or remote branches (\"representatives\" of the branches located in the remote repository) is enabled or disabled in the table. Table Current : : This is the local branch where work is currently being done. The Checkout operation is used to make a branch the current one. The working directory (Git repository) contains exact current the status of this branch. Remote : : This is a \"remote branch\" located in the remote repository. The entry here is used as a representative of this branch (for example, origin\/master as the representative branch of the remote repository). Tracking : : The local branch tracks a remote branch, and is therefore linked with it for the exchange of commits using Git operations. Name : Name of the branch Canonical name : Unique name of the branch Example: refs\/heads\/master Remote : Name of the remote repository which the remote branch references (usually origin ) Upstream branch canonical name Example: refs\/heads\/master Tracked branch name : Name of the remote branch which is tracked Example: origin\/master Tracked branch canonical name : Canonical name of the remote branch which is tracked. Example: remotes\/origin\/master When a branch tracks a remote branch, the following information is relevant. Attention: This display is refreshed only when a Fetch command is executed: Commits ahead : Number of commits on the local (tracking) branch with which its time is \"ahead\" of the remote branch Commits behind : Number of commits which the local (tracking) branch is behind the remote branch.

URL : URL or file path of the remote repository The following protocols are currently supported: HTTP, HTTPS, local. Examples: file:\/\/\/D:\/GitRep\/Remote\/<repository name> , https:\/\/dockerhostpde\/testuser1\/publicproject.git Remove The user is prompted whether to remove the link to the remote repository from the project. Note: All remote branches that belong to the deleted remote repository are deleted. The local branches are retained, but no longer track the deleted remote branches. This action cannot be undone. Rename The Alias name of the remote repository can be changed. Set URL Opens the Set URL for Remote <remote> dialog Here, the path specification (URL or file path) for the currently used remote repository can be changed. Changing the path information and therefore the link to the remote repository can cause remote branches to disappear. Therefore, the user has to reassign the mappings from local branches to remote branches (tracking). The local branches are not changed. Fetch Fetch (prune) The local representative of the remote repository (example: origin\/master ) is updated with the status of the remote repository used by all users. All changes are applied from the remote repository. These are all new branches and new commits in the remote branches. However, the commits are not applied to the tracking branches. Note: To update a local branch with the current status from the remote branch, a Pull operation also has to be performed in the Git Branches view. As an option, you get the Fetch (prune) command by means of the button. This fetch command has the effect that remote branches which no longer exist in the remote repository are deleted from the local repository. Credentials The button opens the Edit Credentials dialog. The User name and Password for access to the remote repository can be specified and edited here. For the selected remote repository ( remote name ), the list box provides every URL for which the repository can provide credentials. The credentials for the selected URL can then be saved, deleted, or changed. It is recommended that you store the credentials for the first URL in the list box because they can then also be reused for other projects within the \"domain\". For detailed information about handling domain-specific credentials, see: Credentials needed. Editing in the dialog replaces the editing in the Windows Credential Manager. Note: A PAT (personal access token) is required when working with GitHUb. Then the PAT has to be specified instead of the password.

Git Pull\/Merge Options Git Pull \/ Git Merge These options affect only Git conflicts . Merge Conflict Strategy Options: Apply automatic mergers (as available) : The automatic merge functionalities should be used whenever available for the affected object type.

For more information, see: Merge Conflicts, \"Relationship Issues\"Use 'ours' for conflicts : CODESYS Git should try to resolve conflicts by always using the contents of the target branch when merging. Use 'theirs' for conflicts : CODESYS Git should try to resolve conflicts by always using the contents of the source branch when merging. Fast Forward Strategy Options: Use fast-forward if possible : Commits of the source branch, whose time are after a commit which already exists in both branches, are automatically applied while merging. In this case, no merge commit entry is created in the history. If the commits are inconsistent, then no fast forward takes place. No fast forward Fast forward only (fail otherwise) : Merging is always attempted with a fast-forward strategy. If the requirements are not fulfilled, then the merge fails with an corresponding message. Typical use case for fast forward: Pull Commit On Success : : If the pull or merge operation was executed without any conflicts, then a commit is also automatically executed. If the fast forward is successful, then the option has no effect.
