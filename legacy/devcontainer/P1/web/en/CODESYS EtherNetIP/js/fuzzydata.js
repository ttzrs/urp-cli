The CODESYS runtime can act as either a scanner or an adapter. CODESYS continues to differentiate between a remote adapter and a local adapter. EtherNet\/IP Remote Adapter: In CODESYS , a remote adapter is a device that you insert in the device tree of a project below an EtherNet\/IP Scanner. EtherNet\/IP -Local Adapter: In CODESYS , a local adapter is a device which you insert in the device tree of a project directly below an Ethernet adapter (TCP) or Modbus port (COM). As a result, you can use the CODESYS runtime as an EtherNet\/IP Adapter. For more general information about fieldbus support in CODESYS , see: Fieldbus Support " },

"body" : "Function : The command establishes a temporary connection to the hardware and detects the devices in the network. Then you can apply the scanned devices into the device tree of your project. Call : Project menu; context menu of a device object in the device tree Requirement : The communication settings to the controller are correct. The gateway and the PLC are started. The device supports the scan function. The following devices provide the scan function: EtherCAT Master, EtherNet\/IP Scanner (IEC), Sercos Master, CANopen Manager, CANopen Manager SIL2, Profinet Controller, and Profibus DP Master. You can perform the device scan immediately if the scan function is permanently implemented in the PLC. When the scan function is implemented in a library, you need to log in only one time to download the library to the controller. The command applies to the master controller selected in the device tree. For example, an PROFINET Controller which has already been added can be selected and the command used to determine the I\/O devices and I\/O modules assigned to it. After performing the scan operation, the Scan Devices dialog opens and displays the scanned devices. Scanning an adapter can fail if the PLC is in RUN mode and a connection already exists from the scanning controller to the adapter. Then the scanning causes another connection to be established to the adapter, which interrupts the existing connection in the case of some adapters. Then the scanner restarts the connection to the adapter, which causes the adapter to interrupt the connection to the scanning controller. For this reason, it makes sense to perform a network scan in STOP mode after a \"Reset\". If RUN mode cannot be interrupted, then scanning is possible without an projected remote adapter (EtherNet\/IP Scanners in the device tree only). For experts When accepting the remote adapter by means of the Copy to Project command, the I\/O dimensions with which the adapter responded are set for the first \"exclusive owner\" connection. In order to log all of the detected assembly instances after scanning, the definition IODRVETHERNETIP_PRINT_SCAN_RESULT must be set. By default, it is scanned by the instance ID 100–199. This can be modified by means of the ParamScanStartOfInstanceAssem and ParamScanLastOfInstanceAssem library parameters from the IoDrvEtherNetIP Library library. This may be necessary, for example to scan in another manufacturer-specific range (assembly instance ID ranges). " },

"body" : "Scanned Devices Device name, Device type, Address, Station name, etc. Data about the scanned device depending on network type. When you change a value in the list of scanned devices, the value is displayed in italics. This indicates that the new value has been changed in the editor in CODESYS , but not in the device. When you download the value to the device, it is displayed normally. Values which indicate differences between the project and the scanned device are displayed in orange. If multiple device descriptions are available for the scanned device, then the name is displayed in bold. The selection of the matching device description is resolved differently for different fieldbuses. For more detailed information, see the corresponding fieldbus chapters. If a device description cannot be found, then the following message is shown: \"Attention! The device was not found in the repository.\" Depending on the bus system, additional information is displayed, such as vendor number and product number. The device cannot be inserted into the project without the installed device description. Show differences to project : The table in the dialog also shows additional configured devices (in the device tree of the project). : The table shows all scanned devices. The configured devices are not shown. Scan for Devices Starts a new search. Copy All Devices to Project The device which is selected in the table is inserted into the device tree in the project. If nothing is selected, then all scanned devices are shown. If you use Copy All Devices to Project to insert devices, which are available in the device tree, to the device tree, then the following should be noted: The data of the Process Data and <...> I\/O Mapping tabs of the existing devices may be overwritten with the data of the recently inserted devices. Configured Devices This part of the dialog is visible only when you select the Show differences to project option. Differences between the scanned and configured devices are color-coded. Devices displayed in green are identical on both sides. Devices displayed in red are available only in the view of the scanned or configured devices. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted above the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted below the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the configured devices are replaced by the selected scanned device. All scanned devices are copied to the project.

"body" : "General Information The global settings for all tasks can be found below the task object on the Task Configuration tab. Generally, for each IEC task, the used input data is read at the start of each task (1) and the written output data is transferred to the I\/O driver at the end of the task (3). The implementation in the I\/O driver is decisive for additional transfer of the I\/O data. It is responsible for the time frame and time point that the actual transfer to the corresponding bus system occurs. The bus cycle task of the PLC can be defined globally for all fieldbuses in the PLC settings. For some fieldbuses, however, you can change this independent of the global setting. The task with the shortest cycle time is used as the bus cycle task (setting: unspecified in the PLC settings). The messages are normally sent on the bus in this task. Other tasks copy only the I\/O data from an internal buffer that is exchanged only with the physical hardware in the bus cycle task. (1) Read inputs from input buffer (6) Output buffer (2) IEC task (7) Copy data to\/from bus (3) Writing outputs to output buffer (9) Bus cycle task, priority 1, 1 ms (4) Bus cycle (10) Bus cycle task, priority 5 (5) Input buffer (11) Bus cycle task, priority 10, interrupted by task 5 Task usage The Task Deployment tab provides an overview of used I\/O channels, the set bus cycle task, and the usage of channels. If an output is written in various tasks, then the status is undefined, as this can be overwritten in each case. If the same inputs are used in various tasks, then it is possible for the input to change during the processing of a task. This happens when the task is interrupted by a task with a higher priority and causes the process image to be read again. Remedy: At the beginning of the IEC task, copy the input variables to variables and then work only with the local variables in the rest of the code. Conclusion: Using the same inputs and outputs in several tasks does not make any sense and can lead to unexpected reactions in some cases. " },
