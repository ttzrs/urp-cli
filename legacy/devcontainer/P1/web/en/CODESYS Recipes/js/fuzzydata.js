"body" : "Use recipes to change or read recipes values for a specific set of variables (recipe definition) on the controller at the same time. You define the basic settings for recipes, such as location and format, in the Recipe Manager object. Insert any number of recipe definitions below this object. You can save a recipe to a file or write directly from files to the PLC. Recipes can be called via the CODESYS development interface, the visualization element, or the application program. Using recipes on remote devices If data source variables are involved and a data source exchange is configured, then variable values from recipes are automatically transferred to\/from another controller. Reading and writing occurs synchronously. This means that all variables configured in a recipe definition are updated at the same time. After reading or writing, you can use the call g_RecipeManager.LastError to check whether or not the transfer was successful ( g_RecipeManager.LastError = 0 ). Loading recipe values from the controller You can apply recipe values on the controller to recipe definitions in the project, even if these definitions have been modified in the project. Requirement: The Recipe management in the PLC is option is selected in the Recipe Manager. Create a recipe definition RecDef1 in the project, containing the variables PLC_PRG.ivar and PLC_PRG.bvar . Insert a recipe R1 : value for PLC_PRG.ivar : 33 ; value for PLC_PRG.bvar : TRUE . Log in to the controller and download the application. The recipe file R1.RecDef1.txtrecipe is saved to the default directory of the controller ($PlcLogic$). Logout and add another variable PLC_PRG.dwvar to the recipe definition in the project. Edit the recipe definition file R1.RecDef1.txtrecipe on the device by changing the value for PLC_PRG.ivar from 33 to 34 . Moreover, add another recipe R2 on the device. To do this, copy the R1.RecDef1.txtrecipe and rename it to R2.RecDef1.txtrecipe . Then edit this file and change the recipe values: PLC_PRG.ivar : 1 , PLC_PRG.bvar : FALSE . Now two recipes R1 and R2 are available on the device. In the project, there is only R1 , and it also contains other values than R1 on the device. Log in to the controller by means of an online change. Click Load Recipes from Device from the context menu. A dialog prompt notifies you that executing the command at the next login may trigger an online change, and that the recipes on the runtime system will overwrite the recipes of the current recipe definition. Confirm that you want to continue. A dialog prompt notifies you that the recipe for PLC_PRG.dwvar loaded on the device cannot yield a value from the controller. Confirm that you want to continue. The value of PLC_PRG.ivar in recipe R1 of the recipe definition in the project changes to 34 . The recipe R2 with the values 1 and FALSE is also listed in the recipe definition now. PLC_PRG.dwvar remains in the recipe definition. " },

Save Recipe Save recipe changes to recipe files automatically When Recipe management in the PLC is selected, there is the following option to save the recipe: : We recommend this option because it helps the Recipe Manager to operate \"normally\". The recipe files on the PLC are updated automatically at runtime whenever a recipe is changed. Load Recipe When Recipe management in the PLC is selected, there are the following two options for downloading from the PLC: Download only for exact match of the variable list : The recipe is only downloaded if the file on the PLC contains all variables from the variable list of the recipe definition of the application and these are sorted in the same order. Additional entries at the end are ignored. If the required match does not exist, then the error status ERR_RECIPE_MISMATCH is set ( RecipeManCommands.GetLastError ). Download variables with matching names : The recipe values are downloaded only for those variables that have the same name in the recipe definition of the application as in the recipe file on the PLC. If the variable lists differ in composition and sorting, then no error status is set. As a result, recipe files can also be downloaded if variables in the file or in the recipe definition have been deleted. Overwrite existing recipes on download : If recipe files with the same name exist on the controller, then they are overwritten with the configured values from the project when the application is started. If the values from the existing recipe files should be loaded instead, then this option has to be disabled. Requirement: The Storage Type is Textual and the Save recipe changes to recipe files automatically option is selected. Write Recipe The following options are available for writing recipe values to the variables on the PLC: Limit the variable to min\/max when recipe value is out of the range : If the recipe contains a value that is outside of the value range specified in the definition, then the defined minimum or maximum value is written to the PLC variable instead of this value. Do not write to a variable when the recipe value is out of the min\/max range : If the recipe contains a value that is outside of the value range specified in the definition, then no value is written to the PLC variable. It retains its current value. Read Recipe The following option is available to read recipe values from the PLC into the recipe in the project: Check recipe for changes Always use the function block RecipeManCommands from RecipeManagement.library to read recipes. Never call the method cyclically. This is because each call can be written to the file system, which is time-intensive and burdens the controller. For example, a Raspberry Pi has a limited number of write cycles. : With each method call, the current PLC variable values are first read into the recipe. Then the system checks whether the values have changed. Only if the values have changed is the recipe saved. This means that the recipe file is overwritten with the current recipes. The option can be used in order to update the recipe file in the local file system only if recipe values have changed on the PLC. However, it affects performance because it generates additional code for checking. : With each method call, the current PLC variable values are first read into the recipe. Then the recipe is written to the recipe file in the local file system. Note: As the file system is written to each call, the controller can be very burdened. " },

Call : Recipes menu Requirement : You have selected the value of a recipe in the recipe definition. The command is executed, the values of the selected recipe are saved to a file. You can define the format in the Recipe Manager settings on the Storage tab. For variables of type REAL or LREAL , a distinction is made whether or not the value is exactly convertible. If it is possible to convert the value exactly, then only the numerical value is saved in the recipe file. If exact conversion is not possible, then a hexadecimal encoded string is written in the recipe file next to the numeric value. This should have the effect that also a non-convertible floating-point number returns the same value. This feature can be disabled with the RECIPE_GENERATE_SIMPLE_STRINGREAL compiler define.

Furthermore, these recipe values overwrite the variable values in the controller. If you want to overwrite only individual recipe variables with new values, then remove the values for the other variables before loading to the recipe file. Entries without value definitions are not read, and therefore updating leaves these variables unchanged on the controller and in the project. For values of the data type REAL\/LREAL, the hexadecimal value is also written to the recipe file in some cases. This is necessary so that the exactly identical value is restored when converting back. In this case, change the decimal value and delete the hexadecimal value.

If recipe variables are defined in the recipe files on the controller, and the recipe variables are missing in the recipe definition of the project, then these variables are ignored when at the time of download.
