The issue occurs when the host name of the SVN repository server is resolved successfully to the IPv4 and IPv6 address, but the SVN server itself ( svnserve or apache mod_svn ) accepts requests via IPV4 only. This results in unusually slow access by some of the dialogs which access the SVN repository. For example, this affects the SVN Repository Browser , Checkout , and SVN switch dialogs. The best solution to the problem is to reconfigure the server so that it also accepts requests via IPv6. Another option is to access the SVN repository via the IPv4 address of the server and then to deactivate IPv6 on the client computer. You can also set up an alternative host name which resolves only the IPv4 address of the server. " },

Select a current version (example: version 1.9.x) when installing the SVN server for the first time. There should not be any problems with an existing server of version 1.8. Avoid server versions 1.7.x and lower. We recommend that you update this because SVN developers no long offer support for this version and earlier. For Windows servers, download the installation packages from the Internet, for example from Apache.org or VisualSVN Server .

Certain actions are no longer possible in the case of different storage profiles at the object level in order to prevent any problems caused by inconsistencies. At the project level, there is at least always the option in the working copy to use the Save Project as command or to adapt the storage format again by reverting to a corresponding revision, even if this can result in minor data losses.

If one or more objects are selected, then these objects and their sub-objects are updated ( Update SVN ). The following cases are possible: Projects are added to the project that are present in the SVN repository, but not in the project. In this case, the message \"Added <object>\" is displayed in the message view. Objects that no longer exist in the SVN repository, but are present in the project locally (and not marked as \"added”), are treated according to the Subversion standard procedure: If local changes are present, then the object remains in the project as unversioned. If there are no local changes, then the object is also deleted locally because the user can retrieve the object from an older version at any time. In this case, \"Deleted object\" is displayed in the message view. Versioned objects which exist in both the SVN repository and the project are updated if they are different. There are three cases to consider: No local changes have been made since the last update: In this case, the local object is overwritten by the contents from the SVN repository. The message Object updated is displayed in the message view. Local changes have been made since the last update and the corresponding object type can be merged. When versions have been merged successfully, the message Objects merged is displayed in the message view. If the command is not executed successfully, then the object is marked as \"Conflicted object\" in the object tree and the message Conflicted object is displayed. Local changes have been made since the last update and the corresponding object type cannot be merged. In this case, the object is marked as \"Conflicted object\" in the object tree and the message Conflicted object is displayed. If only some of the objects are updated, it may be that objects with the same name already exist. For example, this situation can come from moving objects to a folder. For this conflict, you can take the following actions: Do nothing and leave the conflicting objects as they are. Update (and remove) the conflicting objects in order to resolve the conflict.

Merge mergeable changes, ask the user for the others : Changes that can be merged are merged automatically. The user is prompted for all others. Always ask the user, even for mergeable changes : For all changed objects, the user is prompted, even if some of them can be merged automatically. Locks Behavior how CODESYS SVN locks objects when they are changed locally Always try to lock before modification : All objects are locked before they are changed, even if they can be merged. Only lock the objects which don't support merging : Only those objects are locked which cannot be merged automatically. Never acquire a lock automatically : No objects are locked, not even if they can be merged automatically. Marker Use conflict markers when merging objects : If conflicted objects exist that cannot be merged, then these conflicts are marked in the source code with conflict markers. In addition, the object itself is marked as being merged successfully (no conflict). Leave non-mergeable objects as \"conflicted\" : No conflict marker is set. Objects that cannot be merged remain in the status \"Conflicted\". Prompt the user when automatic locking fails. : If it is not possible to lock the object, then the Automatic locking failed dialog opens (see dialog description). Example of a conflict marker Foo();\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nI := I + 1;\n===============\nI := I + 2;\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Checking the server Check server for updates and locks : CODESYS SVN checks in the specified time interval that objects have been updated on the server. Furthermore, it checks whether objects are locked or locks have been stolen. Check interval (minutes) Example: 10 Ignore for comparison Ignore whitespace : Whitespace differences between the current project and the reference project are ignored. Ignore comments : Comments in the programming code are excluded from the comparison. Ignore properties : Object properties are excluded from the comparison. Some of the SVN options can be overwritten by the project-specific settings. Project-specific settings are defined in the  Project Settings – SVN Settings dialog. " },

SWITCHED BOOL TRUE : Parts of the project were branched (with the Switch command).
