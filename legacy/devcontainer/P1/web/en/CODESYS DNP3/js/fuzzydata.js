"body" : "DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol) is an official communication standard for telecontrol. The DNP3 protocol is standardized and further developed by the DNP Users Group. The DNP Users Group consists of vendors and users of devices who use the DNP3 protocol. You can use CODESYS DNP3 to create applications which use the DNP3 protocol. CODESYS DNP3 contains a library with function blocks, among others for: Data points (such as Binary Input and Analog Input ) Outstation A CODESYS DNP3 Outstation can currently communicate via TCP\/IP or serial RS232 with one (or if necessary several) DNP3 Masters. CODESYS DNP3 requires a CmpDNP3 runtime system component which needs to be activated in the PLC. Two libraries are included in CODESYS DNP3 : DNP3.library : This library is intended for use in the application. CmpDNP3.library : This library is used by DNP3.library to access the CmpDNP3 runtime system component and is not intended for use in the application The DNP3.library library contains the documentation of the function blocks intended for application development. Furthermore, CODESYS DNP3 contains examples for using of the function blocks mentioned above. Details about the examples are also included in the documentation of the DNP3.library library. CODESYS DNP3 contains only the function block libraries DNP3.library and CmpDNP3.library . A configurator, as in the case of other fieldbus protocols, is not implemented. " }
