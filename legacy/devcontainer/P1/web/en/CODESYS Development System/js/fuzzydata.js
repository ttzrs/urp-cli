"body" : "In CODESYS 3.5 SP17, we completed a major architectural restructuring. Previously, most of the programming system functionality was bundled into a single interconnected setup. Only CODESYS SoftMotion as well as the paid add-ons of the CODESYS Professional Developer Edition were separate. During the course of restructuring, we further extended this modularization deep into the core functionality. As a result, most of the programming language editors, fieldbus configurators, and code generators are now offloaded to their own add-ons. The same applies to large-scale features such as visualization or symbol configuration, to name two examples. In the core, important infrastructure features remain, such as the user interface framework (menu system, navigator, message view, etc.), the compiler front-end, and components for project handling and communication with controllers. It should be mentioned that in the future even more parts can be moved from the core to separate add-ons. We will primarily use this modularization to separate the version cycles of the individual components. In the past, it was necessary to converge the entire CODESYS development regarding new features and improvements to a single date each year (namely the release date of a service pack). Features which were just barely still incomplete usually led to the service pack being postponed. Features which clearly did not fit into the schedule were postponed into the future by a full year. In our own interest as well as in the interest of all CODESYS users, we want to remove this interconnectedness so that in the future we can version and release each add-on independently. For CODESYS users, there are a number of immediate and significant advantages. Features are released promptly after completion and are available as soon as possible. Beta versions of add-ons can be provided to interested users in order to have the possibility for punctual feedback. In doing so, a beta version of this kind can be run in an otherwise stable environment. Unneeded add-ons can be removed, which is good for both storage space as well as overall performance. Of course, this flexibility is offset by increased complexity. In this whitepaper, we want to describe the following: Existing restrictions Actions we have taken to make the complexity manageable Recommended approach for typical use cases " },

"body" : "The keyword \"compatibility\" conceals the greatest increase in complexity which results from modularization. Whereas traditionally there was linear development and as a result the compatibility issue was simple (\"the new CODESYS can read an old project\"), in a high-modular environment the matter is incomparably more difficult. The decisions which we have made and which are explained in more detail in the following sections have consciously been made not on the basis on what is technically feasible, but on what is reasonably manageable. Project compatibility The question here is to which extent an CODESYS installation can open a project or library which has been created with another CODESYS installation. We have not changed this mechanism. The behavior is identical to the CODESYS versions before the modularization. If there is data in the project which cannot be read or interpreted with the current version because it was generated from a newer environment, then the respective objects are flagged with a red cross in the navigator, and identified with either [incomplete] (→ the editor can still be opened) or [unknown] (→ the editor can no longer be opened). In both cases, the project cannot be downloaded to the controller (because an undefined program behavior could result), and only Save as is available (in order to prevent accidental overwriting of the original project and therefore data loss). This behavior has proven successful for years. Code compatibility The question here is whether or not in one CODESYS installation you can generate always binary-equivalent controller code for a project as with another CODESYS installation. In simple terms: Can you open any project with a CODESYS installation and log in to the controller without an online change or download? For this purpose, there was the concept of the compiler version up through CODESYS 3.5 SP17. We will remove the compiler version as of CODESYS 3.5 SP18. If you need to be able to log in to a controller with a project without performing an online change or download, then you have to open the project with an CODESYS installation which is exactly suitable. There are a number of powerful arguments for the decision to abandon the concept of the compiler version: Not only the compiler is responsible for the generated code, but also the programming language editors and fieldbus configurators that are involved. As these have now been offloaded to independently versioned add-ons, there can in principle no longer be one unified, comprehensive compiler version. We believe that the attempt to bundle a variety of different add-on-specific compiler versions into a kind of compiler version profile is overly complex from the user perspective. For CODESYS UML (part of the CODESYS Professional Developer Edition ), there has been a separate language model generation version for years, but even with this one add-on, this concept has not proven itself in practice, let alone with the current multitude of add-ons. In its simple form, the compiler version has already required detailed user knowledge. At the very latest, correcting an accidentally incorrectly set version was often problematic. Users who had bad experiences with this, or who were generally not convinced by this concept, had already performed multiple maintenance installations in the past in order to be able to log in safely to running controllers in the event of maintenance. As we will see below, we now provide robust interactive support for this case. Every new compiler version inflates our internal code base. On the one hand, this has a negative impact on performance and on the installation size. On the other hand, we can by no means test all combinations in this code base. Furthermore, as compiler version maintenance is also error-prone to a certain extent, this is in direct contradiction to our continually increasing demand for quality. In other words, we cannot guarantee that the previous compiler version concept will work reliably in all cases, and we would be even less able to do so if we had to make this concept even more complex due to modularization. The two previous arguments can be summarized as follows: It is attractive from the user perspective to be able to produce a reliably suitable version for the case of maintenance by means of our tool support without having to deal with a compiler version at all. Runtime system compatibility The question here is to what extent a CODESYS installation is compatible with a runtime system version. In other words, can you log in to an old controller with a new CODESYS installation and use the available online functions? We have not changed the associated mechanisms. Basically, programming system versions and runtime system versions can be combined in any way, with the following limitations: A new programming system version may provide functions which an older runtime system version does not yet support. In this case, the function is not available. An older programming system version may not work with a newer runtime system version if security enhancements prohibit it (for example, enforced user management or a new type of encryption algorithm).

"body" : "The scenarios described in this section can of course also be used in combination. We believe that this covers the overwhelming majority of practice-relevant cases and would like to support them as best as possible with our tools. In the future, we also want to further optimize our software according to these use cases. Scenario Recommendation Tool Support Everyday development on a running project The CODESYS version as well as the accompanying add-ons should always be kept up-to-date. We are constantly working on big and small improvements, bug fixes, and security updates so that the newest version is always the best version ever. There is little reason to hold on to old versions. The CODESYS Installer shows all updates which are available for an installation. These updates can be downloaded and installed with just a few mouse clicks. Furthermore, the Notification Center, which is integrated in CODESYS as a dockable window, also lists available updates (exactly suitable to the currently executed installation). From here it is possible to jump directly to the CODESYS Installer so that it does not have to be continuously active. All setups and add-ons provided by us are signed. Therefore, downloading them over the Internet is safe. We have extended the Package Manager with corresponding (partly interactive) test methods. Everyday development on an running project under the constraint that several people in a team have to use a uniform installation As above. One person in the team installs available updates on their own and tests them. Upon successful clearance, the new reference installation is distributed within the team. In the CODESYS Installer , existing installations can be exported as a description file. This file can be used to create an identical installation on another machine. This mechanism is also available from the command line, so it is particularly suitable for automated environments. Trying out the newest add-on features in a safe environment An existing productive CODESYS installation is duplicated. In this installation, any beta versions of add-ons are installed and updated as needed. The CODESYS installations which are used productively remain completely untouched by this. Normal work on projects is not affected. The CODESYS Installer allows you to easily create a copy of an existing installation. For each installation, you can choose whether only released updates or also experimental beta updates should be provided and installed. Previously, a particular service pack or patch could only ever be installed one time on each machine. Since the introduction of the installer, this restriction has been lifted. Maintenance on an existing controller without changing the associated existing project. There must be a guarantee that it is possible to log in to the controller without performing an online change or a download. A CODESYS installation is created which is exactly suitable to the project. Without having to deal with compiler versions, the generation of binary-equivalent controller code is guaranteed. If differences between the current CODESYS installation and the created version are detected when loading a project, then you are given the option to download and install an installation which is exactly suitable to the project. The project will then be opened automatically in this new created version. Furthermore, when loading it is of course possible to select suitable installations which already exist on the machine. In CODESYS Installer , installations get a user-defined name. In this way, you will not get confused if you have to manage a large number of installations. In order not to continuously receive update suggestions for such a special compatibility installation, these are separated from the update channel by default. Further development on an older existing project The project is further developed in a current CODESYS installation. Because changes are made to the code anyway, the pending online change or download is irrelevant. As before, CODESYS can load older projects without any losses. If a required add-on is missing, then it is possible to download and install it directly from the project load operation. Otherwise, write and download protection protects both the project itself and the controller. " },

"body" : "Storage format Use Case Support Loading projects in new CODESYS version without data loss ✓ Saving projects for older CODESYS versions ✓ Opening new projects in old CODESYS versions -- Existing projects which are opened with a newer CODESYS version are kept in \"compatibility mode\" for as long as possible. As long as you only make changes to the project which do not require any new functionality, the storage format remains the same. This is why the original CODESYS version can continue to open and edit the project without data loss. If you make changes which require new data to be saved in the project, then you will be notified interactively about this situation. You have the option of undoing the last changes if a compatibility breach would be unacceptable. You can often open projects with newer memory versions in older CODESYS versions, but this is strongly discouraged. Whether or not you can open projects depends on the availability of plug-in types in the old version. A corresponding message is displayed when loading such a project. You also have the option of saving a project for an older version of CODESYS by executing the File → Save as command. In this case, information about which objects are affected by the data loss is displayed in the Messages view. However, saving projects for an old version affects the explicitly only storage format. There is no full conversion of the project in which the compiler version or similar settings are adapted to match the old version. Online behavior Use Case Support Compiling a project, which was created with an old CODESYS version, in a new CODESYS version ✓ Log in without online change in a new version. -- New CODESYS versions cannot generate the same code for existing projects as the older version with which the project was created. If you need to log in to a running application without an online change or download, then you need to open the project with the version which was last loaded on the controller. The CODESYS Installer and the project analysis help you to restore the original version if it does not already exist. As a result, this means that opening the project with a newer or different version requires the project to be updated. This will most likely require a new download of the runtime environment. You also need to test the application for possible changes in behavior which result from new functions or bugfixes in the compiler or the graphical editors. In general, an attempt is made to minimize new compiler errors or behavioral changes for existing projects in order to keep the effort for updating to new versions as low as possible. The following points need to be observed for compatibility with existing runtimes: New functions in CODESYS are typically enabled in the device description. As a result, they are disabled for older runtime systems or older device descriptions. The versions of all external libraries are resolved by means of the device description. As a result, they are matched to the corresponding runtime system. Internal libraries are resolved by the CODESYS version, regardless of the version of the runtime system. The communication services are structured according to a shared format with tags. Unknown tags are ignored by the runtime system. As a result, it is possible to change the communication service, but the programming system will not expect the runtime system to interpret the new information. " },

This range can be selected by the device manufacturer with the following settings in the runtime system (see SysTargetItf.h of the runtime system): SYSTARGETKEY_INT_TARGET_VERSION_MASK \"TargetVersionMask\": Setting to specify a mask for checking the target version for compatibility with the device description. Only the significant digits are checked in the mask. SYSTARGETKEY_INT_TARGET_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY_MASK \"TargetVersionCompatibilityMask\": Setting to specify a compatibility mask for checking the target version for compatibility with the device description. A device description which is lower than the target version or the same is accepted. A higher version of the device description is rejected. Example current CODESYS CODESYS Version CODESYS Control Version Device Description Version Recommended Restrictions Comment 3.5.19.0 3.5.19.0 3.5.19.0 Yes, optimal -- This is the optimal combination. 3.5.19.0 3.5.12.0 3.5.12.0 Yes -- This is a typical compatibility case. 3.5.19.0 3.5.12.0 3.5.10.0 No, but possible Warning when logging in to the controller that the DevDesc does not match This is possible because the DevDesc is older than the version of the controller. 3.5.19.0 3.5.12.0 3.5.19.0 No No access to the controller By default, this is rejected because DevDesc and the runtime system are not compatible with each other. 3.5.19.0 3.5.10.0 3.5.10.30 No No access to the controller This is possible because the DevDesc is within the compatible range of 3.5.10.x. Example of an older CODESYS CODESYS Version CODESYS Control Version Device Description Version Recommended Restrictions Comment 3.5.17.0 3.5.19.0 3.5.19.0 No Incompatibilities are possible due to security corrections in the runtime system. The set of all external libraries must be available in CODESYS . It is possible that in the external libraries there are newer IEC language resources used which lead to compilation errors. 3.5.17.0 3.5.19.0 3.5.17.0 No, but possible Incompatibilities are possible due to security corrections in the runtime system.

"body" : "Use Case Support A newer runtime system loads older boot projects. ✓ An older runtime system loads newer boot projects. -- It must be possible to load existing boot projects from the runtime system within a main version. An existing boot project is checked against the type designation of a target ( VendorID , DeviceID , and the DeviceVersion since V3.5.8.0) before loading. Retain variables from a saved retain file ( <application>.ret ) or from the SRAM must always be compatible. A checksum is saved in a separate file for each retain area. The same checksum is saved in the boot project. This checksum is generated by the compiler from the retain data and is an identification of all variables in the retain area with their respective types. If the checksum of the retain data and the checksum in the boot project do not match, then you have several options in the runtime system to select the behavior. You can specify these options in the [CmpApp] section of the cfg file: Bootproject.RetainMismatch.Init = 1 : The boot project is loaded and retains are initialized. Bootproject.RetainMismatch.Exception = 1 : The boot project is loaded, but the application remains in the stop state, and is set to an exception state. This condition can be corrected with a manual reset. No setting [DEFAULT] : The boot project is not loaded and an error message is added to the logger. In runtime system version 3.5.7.0 and lower, the checksum was calculated from the entire data of the application. In newer versions, the checksum is calculated only from the data in the retain area. This means that the retain data can be loaded into a boot project with newer versions, even if the project has changed, as long as these changes do not involve any changes to the retain data. " },

"body" : "In this tutorial, you will program a simple refrigerator controller. In addition to the sample project, which you will create here step by step, the finished project contains a complete visualization with operation and diagnosis. The finished RefrigeratorControl.projectarchive project can be found in the CODESYS installation directory in the Projects directory. As with a conventional refrigerator, the temperature is specified by the user via a rotary control. The refrigerator determines the actual temperature using a sensor. When it is too high, the refrigerator starts the compressor with an adjustable delay. The compressor cools until the desired temperature is reached, minus a hysteresis of 1 degree. The hysteresis is intended to prevent the actual temperature from fluctuating too much around the set temperature, which would result in the compressor constantly switching itself off and on. When the door is open, a lamp lights up inside the refrigerator. When the door is open too long, a beeping audible signal sounds. If the compressor does not reach the set temperature despite activity of the motor over a long period of time, then the buzzer emits a steady audible signal. Engineering: The cooling activity is controlled in the main program of the application. The signal management is controlled in another POU. The required standard function blocks are available in the Standard library. Because no physical temperature sensors and no physical actuators are connected in this sample project, you will also write a program to simulate the increase and decrease of the temperature. This will allow you to monitor the operation of the refrigerator controller afterwards in online mode. Variables that are to be used by all POUs need to be defined in a global variable list. " },

"body" : "You will now describe the main function of the application program in the main PLC_PRG POU, which is created by default. The compressor is activated and cools when the actual temperature is higher than the set temperature plus a hysteresis. The compressor switches off when the actual temperature is less than the set temperature minus the hysteresis. To describe this functionality in the CFC implementation language, follow the steps below: In the device tree, double-click PLC_PRG . The CFC editor opens in the PLC_PRG tab. The declaration editor appears above the graphical editor area in textual or tabular form. The ToolBox view is on the right side. In the ToolBox view, select the Input element and drag it to the CFC editor below the PLC_PRG tab. The nameless entry ??? has been inserted. In the CFC editor, click ??? at the input, and then click to open the Input Assistant. In the Variables category, select the rTempActual variable below Application → Glob_Var . This is how to reference the global variable rTempActual here. The input name is Glob_Var.rTempActual . As in Step 3, create another input with the name of the global variable Glob_Var.rTempSet . Create another input, and then click ??? and replace them with the name rHysteresis . Because this is not the name of a known variable, the Auto Declare dialog opens. The name is already used in the dialog. In the Auto Declare dialog, specify the Type as REAL and Initialization as 1 . Click the OK button. The variable rHysteresis appears in the declaration editor. In the ToolBox view, select Block element and drag it to the CFC editor below the PLC_PRG tab. The POU opens in the CFC Editor. Replace ??? with ADD . The POU adds all inputs that are connected to it. Connect the Glob_Var.rTempSet input to the ADD POU. To do this, click the output pin of the input and drag it to the upper input pin of the ADD POU. In the same way, connect the input rHysteresis with the lower input of the ADD POU. The two inputs rHysteresis and Glob_Var.rTempSet are now added by ADD . To move an element in the editor, click an empty space in the element or click the frame, so that the element is selected (red border, red highlight). Drag the element to the desired position. Create another POU to the right of the ADD POU. Its purpose is to compare Glob_Var.rTempActual with the sum of Glob_Var.rTempSet and rHysteresis . Assign the GT function (greater than) to the POU. The GT POU works as follows: IF (upper input > lower input) THEN output := TRUE; Connect the input Glob_Var.rTempActual to the upper input of the GT POU. Connect the output of the ADD POU to the lower input of the GT POU. Now use the block element to create a function block to the right of the GT POU which starts and stops the compressor depending on the input conditions (Set – Reset). Specify the name SR in the ??? field. Press the Enter key to close the open input field above the POU ( SR_0 ). The Auto Declare dialog opens. Declare the variable with the name SR_0 and the data type SR . Click the OK button. The SR POU from the Standard library is instantiated. SR is used for the definition of THEN at the output of the GT POU. The inputs SET1 and RESET appear. Connect the output pin on the right of the GT POU to the SET1 input of the SR_0 POU. SR can set a Boolean variable from FALSE to TRUE and back again. When the condition at the input SET1 is satisfied, the Boolean variable is set to TRUE . The variable is reset again when the condition at RESET is satisfied. The Boolean (global) variable in our example is Glob_Var.xCompressor . Create an Output element and assign it to the global variable Glob_Var.xCompressor . Drag a connecting line between Glob_Var.xCompressor and the output pin Q1 of SR . Now specify the condition under which the compressor should switch off again (in this case, the RESET input of the SR POU gets a TRUE signal). To do this, formulate the opposite condition to that above. Use the SUB (subtraction) and LT (less than) POUs to do this. The result is the following CFC chart: " },

"body" : "In another POU, you will now implement the signal management for the alarm buzzer and for switching the lamp on and off. The ladder diagram (LD) implementation language is suitable for this. Handle each of the following signals in their own networks: When the compressor runs too long because the temperature is too high, a continuous audible signal sounds. When the door is open too long, an intermittent signal sounds. The light is on as long as the door is open. In the device tree, right-click the Application object and add a POU object of type Program with the Ladder (LD2) implementation language. Name the program as Signals . The Signals program is listed in the device tree next to PLC_PRG . The ladder diagram editor opens in the Signals tab. The declaration editor appears in the upper part, the ToolBox view to the right. The ladder diagram contains an empty network. Create a program in the network so that an audible signal sounds when the compressor runs too long without reaching the specified temperature. To do this, insert a TON timer POU in the next steps. It switches a Boolean signal to TRUE after a specified time. In the ToolBox view, drag the Block element and drop it into the empty network to an available insertion position. The block is displayed as a box with inputs and outputs. Double-click the three question marks ( ??? ) in the block and click the symbol in the line editor. The Input Assistant dialog opens. In the Input Assistant dialog, in the Standard function blocks category, in the Standard library, select the TON Timer and click OK . Now in the line editor of the block, which shows the function block name TON , press the Enter key. The TON POU is displayed with its inputs and outputs. To remove the EN input and the ENO output, select the block and click the EN\/ENO → EN in the context menu. Now the block has only the IN and PT inputs and the Q and ET outputs. Double-click the three question marks [???] directly above the block, specify TON_0 as the instance name, and press the Enter key. You have confirmed the instance name. The Auto Declare dialog opens. Click OK to confirm the dialog. Now the inserted TON POU is instantiated with the name TON_0 . Program the block to be activated as soon as the compressor starts running. First drag the Contact ladder element from the ToolBox view in front of the IN input of the block. Double-click the three question marks and click the icon in the line editor ( ). In the Input Assistant, now select the already declared global variable xCompressor and click OK . The variable name Glob_Var.xCompressor is displayed above the contact. When you begin to type a variable name at the input position, you automatically get a list of all variables with names that begin with the typed characters and can be used at this point. This assistance is a default setting in the CODESYS options for SmartCoding. Insert the signal that is to be activated. To do this, drag a Coil from the ToolBox view, Ladder category, to the Q output of the TON block. Specify the name Glob_Var.xSignal for the coil. Define the time period from the activation of the POU TON_0 until the signal should sound. This definition takes place via the variable Glob_Var.timAlarmThreshold , which you insert for this purpose at the input PT of TON_0 . To do this, move the mouse pointer to the left end of the input pin of input PT . Click the fine-edged box which is now displayed to left of the input pin and specify the variable name. Press the Enter key. The Auto Declare dialog opens. Click OK to confirm the dialog. The newly declared variable is displayed in the declaration part. Right-click the TON POU and click Remove unused pins in the context menu. The unused output ET is removed. In the second network of the LD, program so that the signal sounds intermittently when the door is open too long. Use the mouse to drag an Network element from the ToolBox view to the insertion point below Network 1. An empty network with the number 2 appears. As in the first network, implement a TON POU for time-controlled activation of the signal. This time it is triggered by the global variable Glob_Var.xDoorOpen at the input IN . At the input PT , add the global variable Glob_Var.timDoorOpenThreshold . From the Util library, add a BLINK POU at the output Q of the TON POU in this network and instantiate it with the name Blink_0 . The BLINK_0 POU clocks the signal forwarding Q and therefore Glob_Var.xSignal . First, drag two Contact elements from the ToolBox view to the OUT output of the POU. Assign the variable TON_1.Q to the contact directly after the output Q and the global variable Glob_Var.xDoorOpen to the second contact. Insert a Coil element after the two contacts and assign the global variable Glob_Var.xSignal to it. Declare the local variable timSignalTime : TIME := T#1S; and insert this variable at the inputs TIMELOW and TIMEHIGH . The cycle time is 1 second for TRUE and 1 second for FALSE . Right-click the TON POU and click Remove unused pins in the context menu. The unused output ET is removed. In the third network, program so that the lamp lights up as long as the door is open. Add an additional network and a contact. Assign the variable GlobVar.xDoorOpen to the contact. The inserted contact leads directly to a coil. Add a coil to the right of the contact and assign the global variable Glob_Var.xLamp to the coil. CODESYS processes the networks of an LD one after the other. Now install a jump to Network 3 at the end of Network 1 in order to ensure that either only Network 1 or only Network 2 is executed: When you hover the mouse pointer over the 3rd line in the top left-hand edge of the network, the information <insert jump here> is displayed. Double-click this position and specify DoorIsOpen: as the jump label in the line editor. Select the Network 1. From the ToolBox view, Ladder Diagram category, drag the Jump element to the insertion position marked with a triangle in front of the Glob_Var.xSignal coil. The jump element appears. The jump destination is still specified as ??? . Double-click the three question marks [???] and click the symbol in the line editor. In the Input Assistant dialog, select DoorIsOpen from the possible label identifiers and click OK to confirm. The label to Network 3 is implemented. The LD program now looks like this: " },

A visualization created with CODESYS Visualization is installed in the completed sample project for this tutorial, which is provided with the CODESYS standard installation ( Projects directory). You can download this project to the controller and start it to see it working together with the visualization. When started, the Live_Visu begins with a representation of the refrigerator which reproduces the operation of the simulation program without you having to input any data. However, you can open and close the door by clicking the on\/off switch. It is possible to adjust the default temperature by means of the needle of the rotary control. We will not cover the creation of the visualization in this tutorial. An corresponding tutorial is planned in the help for CODESYS Visualization. " },

You can see the actual values of the application variables in the online views of the POU editors or in monitoring lists. In the example here, we will focus on monitoring in the POU editor. Requirement: The application is running on the controller. In the device tree, double-click the objects PLC_PRG , Signals , Simulation , and Glob_Var to open the online views of the editors. In the declaration part of each view, the actual value of the variable (1) on the controller appears in the table of expressions in the Value column (3) (see figure). Monitoring in the implementation part depends on the implementation language. In the case of non-Boolean variables, the value is always located in a rectangular field to the right of the identifier.

In the graphical editors, the value of a Boolean variable is shown by the color of the output connecting line (black for FALSE and blue for TRUE ): Observe how the variable values change in the various POUs. For example, you can see in the GVL Glob_Var how the values of rTempActual and xCompressor change due to the processing of the simulation program. One-time setting of variable values on the controller: Set the focus in the online view of the GVL Glob_Var . To set a new specified value, double-click in the Prepared Value column (2) next to the expression rTempSet . An input field opens. Specify the value 9 and exit the input field.

Click three more times to see that you can toggle the prepared value between TRUE , FALSE , and empty. To write the prepared value TRUE one time only to the variable, press Ctrl + F7 . The two values are each transferred to the Value column (3). Now the variable xDoorOpen no longer changes its value and the set temperature is 9 degrees.

"body" : "In this case, the Project Inspection wizard guides you through the possible actions. In your current CODESYS installation, open a project which was last saved with a different installation (different version and\/or more add-ons). CODESYS interrupts the loading operation and provides you with information and suitable options in the Project Inspection wizard ( Project Inspection – Overview dialog) to allow for loading. If the project was saved with CODESYS version 3.5.19.0 or higher, then the Details button will be displayed to open the Differences dialog. Here you see which add-ons were installed when you saved the project and whether and how they are available in the current installation. Select one of the two basic options: Option 1: This project is still in a development phase. I want to open it in this version and do not mind that a different code may be generated. You load the project with the unsuitable version and accept the possibility of changed code or losses due to missing components. This could be an acceptable option for projects which are still in the development phase. Option 2: This project has already been deployed on a machine\/plant. I want to generate exactly the same code and hence need the possibility to log in without any change. This option is necessary when the code of the project must not change under any circumstances. The wizard should make sure that the installation is suitable. Therefore, the wizard first scans the computer for other existing installations which are suitable. If it finds suitable installations, then you can select one of them and start it instead of the currently open installation. If the wizard does not find a suitable installation, then it offers to download and run a suitable setup. The required and optional add-ons are listed. You can configure the download accordingly and then run it through the CODESYS Installer . If you choose Option 1: After Next , you still get the option to have missing add-ons installed later for editing all objects of the project. In this case, the wizard checks if the necessary add-on setups are available and starts the CODESYS Installer in the next step. If you open the project without this post-installation, then the objects affected by missing add-ons cannot be edited. The number of missing add-ons is displayed in the status bar of the project. If you choose Option 2: After Next , the Project Inspection – Selection dialog opens. Under Use another installation , the wizard shows other available installations on the computer which are suitable for continued use of the project. If no suitable installations are found, then there is the alternative Download and setup a new installation .

"body" : "Compilation The project has to be compilable without errors in CoDeSys V2.3 . Note: CODESYS stills issues warnings in V3 when compiling. These are caused by implicit conversions, which can lead to a loss of information (for example through sign changes). CODESYS V3 checks \"case\" statements against the switch variable: CASE USINT OF INT is not checked in CoDeSys V2.3 , but it issues an error message when imported into V3 . Controller configuration The Controller Configuration of a CoDeSys V2.3 project cannot be imported into V3 . You need to create the device configuration again and declare the variables used in the controller configuration again. Network Variables For network variables, CODESYS creates V3 GVL objects and imports the variable declarations. However, the network properties are not imported. See the description of the network variable exchange for this. Libraries All variables and constants that are used in a library also have to be declared in the library. It has to be possible to compile the library in CoDeSys V2.3 without errors. Syntactic and semantic restrictions since CoDeSys V2.3 FUNCTIONBLOCK is not a valid keyword instead of FUNCTION_BLOCK . TYPE (declaration of a structure) must be followed by a \":\". ARRAY initialization** must have parentheses. INI is no longer supported (you need to replace this in the code by the Init method). In function calls it is no longer possible to mix explicit with implicit parameter assignments. Therefore the order of the parameter input assignments can be changed: fun(formal1 := actual1, actual2); \/\/ -> error message fun(formal2 := actual2, formal1 := actual1); \/\/ same semantics as the following line: fun(formal1 := actual1, formal2 := actual2); CoDeSys V2.3 pragmas are not converted. They produce an warning in V3 . The TRUNC operator now converts to the data type DINT instead of INT . CODESYS automatically adds a corresponding type conversion for a CoDeSys V2.3 import. Visualization Placeholders and their replacement Placeholder: PLC_PRG.$LocalVar$.aArr[0] VAR_INPUT: localVar: MyStruct; Usage: localVar.aArr[0] Substitution: localVar := PLC_PRG.myStructVar Placeholder: $Var$.aArr[0] VAR_INPUT: Var : MyStruct; Usage: Var.aArr[0] Substitution: Var := PLC_PRG.myStructVar Placeholder: PLC_PRG.myStructVar.aArr[$Index$] VAR_INPUT: Index : INT; Usage: PLC_PRG.myStructVar.aArr[Index] Substitution: Index := 0 Problematic placeholders Placeholders within a text Text: $axle$-Axis Correction: localVar : STRING; Text: %s-Axis Text variable: localVar Placeholder describes only one part of a variable name axis$axis$spur$spur$.fActPosition Correction: Define only one placeholder for the axis$axis$spur$spur$ placeholder. axis_spur : MyFunctionBlock; Then directly transfer the corresponding instance of the function block. axis_spur := PLC_PRG.axis1spur2; Placeholder is replaced by an expression $Expression$ -> PLC_PRG.var1 + PLC_PRG.var2 Correction: You need to transfer the expression to an auxiliary variable and then transfer this auxiliary variable as an instance. Placeholder describes a program name: $Program$.bToggle - PLC_PRG.bToggle D The converter cannot transfer this form of setting placeholders in V3 . However, you will rarely use it in practice. Placeholder is replaced by different types: $Var$ -> Replacement 1 : PLC_PRG.n (INT) -> Replacement 2 : PLC_PRG.st (STRING) Correction: Define two different placeholders in the interface for this. The visualization is located in a library. You replace the placeholder later from any desired project when you use the visualization there. Correction: Here you need to replace the TYPE_NONE data types manually. However, there is also the possibility for you to integrate the library in a project and the placeholder is correctly replaced. If you now import this project, the data type is also determined correctly in the library. Non-importable elements Trend, ActiveX: Importing is not possible because the implementation differs considerably. In V3 , a corresponding warning is issued and a corresponding manual reproduction is required. Programming languages: ST, IL, FBD No restrictions Programming language: LD CODESYS imports function blocks with parallel branches in such a way that the part before the branch is repeated for each branch. This corresponds to the generated code which CoDeSys V2.3 creates for parallel branches. Programming language: SFC Step variables explicitly declared by the user must be declared locally in the SFC editor. You may not declare them as VAR_INPUT, VAR_OUTPUT or VAR_INOUT, because CODESYS cannot automatically adapt the calls. Explanation: Steps no longer use Boolean variables for the management of the internal states in V3 , but also structures of the type SFCStepType . Identifier: the following identifiers may not begin with an underscore character: Names of IEC actions in the tree Variables that are called in an IEC association list Names of transitions that have been programmed out Explanation: In V3 , the implicit variables which CODESYS creates for actions are given an underscore character as prefix. An invalid identifier with a double underscore character would result. Programming language: CFC Large boxes: The layout of large boxes can lose quality due to an import. The boxes may overlap one another too much. (Correction planned.) Macros: Macros cannot be imported. (Correction planned.) " },

"body" : "In the Devices view (also called the \"device tree\"), you organize applications according to target device. In this view, you can see the PLC hardware and fieldbus systems, configure the hardware communication, and assign applications. The root node of the device tree is a symbolic node entry: <project name> . You insert device objects below this node for one or more PLCs, also referred to as \"target systems\". Each device object represents a specific hardware component, for example a controller, fieldbus, bus coupler, drive, I\/O module, or monitor. When you add objects, an add assistant helps you by offering all possible devices from your local device repository. If you are already connected to a controller network, then you can scan the hardware for available devices and save them to the device tree in the current configuration. For creating device objects in the device tree (mapping to the controlling hardware environment), specific rules apply (see below). The hierarchical layout of application objects and device objects defined the scope of other objects, such as libraries and GVLs. There are programmable devices and strictly parameterizable devices. The device type defines the possible insertion point in the device tree and the selection of objects that you can insert below the device. Programmable devices automatically get an additional PLC Logic node below the device object, which is strictly for organizational purposes. Below this node, you insert the objects that are required for programming the device (this means the application(s) and GVLs or text lists, for example). Each device is defined by a device description and must be installed on the local system in order to be inserted into the device tree. The device description file defines the device properties for configurability, programmability, and possible connections to other devices. The POUs view includes objects that can be used throughout the project. Programming objects that are intended for a specific application must be inserted below the application object in the Devices view (device tree). Note the option of letting the active application run on a \"simulated device\", which is provided by default within the development system. Currently, this simulation option is available for the CODESYS Control Win target system. In simulation mode, you can also test the online functionality of the application without hardware. Click Online → Simulation to enable simulation mode. Note the option of establishing a connection to the device by means of the Online Config Mode command for an application, without having to load the application beforehand. This is useful for the initial commissioning of an I\/O system because you can reference and test the I\/Os with it in the PLC configuration, before you have programmed and downloaded the actual application. Example of a device tree: (1) Programmable device (with application) (2) Symbolic device name (3) Device type, defined in the device description (4) Purely parameterizable device A device entry in the device tree consists of a symbol, the symbolic device name that is editable in the tree, and the device type (device name as defined in the device description). All devices with bus cycle settings and tasks which are used for any number of bus cycle tasks are also marked with the symbol. A tooltip is also displayed for tasks and devices with this symbol. For the tasks, the tooltip shows the devices used. For the devices, the tooltip shows the tasks. You configure device communication, parameters, and IO mappings in the dialogs of the device editor . Open this editor by double-clicking the device object. " },

"body" : "Rules and Procedures for Arranging and Configuring Objects in the Device Tree Inserting objects To insert a device object, click Add Device or Insert Device by right-clicking in the device tree. For other objects, click Add Object . CODESYS always provides the suitable objects at the currently selected position in the tree. Example: Modules for a PROFIBUS DP slave can be inserted only below a respective slave object, and applications inserted only below programmable devices. The selection of device objects also depends on which devices are installed in the device repository. The following recommendations and rules apply for the names of the objects: The size of 80 characters should not be exceeded. A compiler warning is generated for more than 80 characters. Only alphanumeric characters and the underscore are permitted. The first character must be a letter or an underscore. You can only insert device objects on the level directly below the <project name> root node. If you select another object type, such as a text list, then CODESYS automatically inserts this into the POUs view (project-global pool). Inserting applications You can insert an Application object only below the PLC Logic node (a programmable device). All applications must be named uniquely for each device. Below each application, you can insert more objects that are required for programming, such as POUs, DUTs, GVLs, or visualizations. Below each application, you need to insert a task configuration and configure the respective program calls (from application-specific POUs, or POU \"instances\" from the POUs view). If multiple applications exist directly below a device, then you will need to define settings for the I\/O processing of the device. This includes the variables of the application which CODESYS uses for communication with the target system. The settings are configured on the PLC Settings tab of the device editor. Hierarchical layout of applications and scopes: You can add an application below another application. We name the resulting construct: \"parent application\" – \"child application\". In this case, the following applies: The child application can access objects in the parent application, but not the other direction. The reason for this is that a child application should always be removable or exchangeable without affecting the parent application. NOTE After the parent application has been changed, a child application is removed from the controller when an online change is performed. Insert devices CODESYS inserts a device object in the tree as a node. If nodes are defined in the device description, then they are inserted automatically. A subnode can also represent a programmable device. Order of device objects in the tree (from top to bottom): For each level, the programmable devices (PLC Logic) are listed first and then the other types in alphabetical order. Update devices A device which has been inserted into the device tree can be replaced by another version of the same device or by a device of another type ( Update devices ). A configuration tree below the device is available when possible. Moving and deleting objects You can use the standard commands Cut , Copy , Paste , and Delete on objects, or drag an object to another position. When you copy objects, the new object gets the same name with a consecutive number. Network scan (of the current hardware) By default, creating the PLC configuration in the device tree is supported by the device editors with scan functionality. The current hardware environment is scanned and the detected modules are displayed in a dialog. From there, you can save the required device directly to the device tree. See the Scan Devices command.

"body" : "With CODESYS you can test the correct wiring of the I\/Os and the fieldbus of your target system, without having to develop a real application for the controller and loading it to the controller beforehand. This is interesting for the initial commissioning phase. Use the \"Simple online configuration mode\" for this. If an application already exists on the controller, then as an option you could also use the \"Advanced online configuration mode\" if the device supports this. This allows you to read device parameters without having to log in with the affected application from CODESYS . Simple online configuration mode You can use the Online Config Mode command in the context menu of the PLC object in the device tree in order to create an implicit application. CODESYS automatically downloads the application to the PLC and automatically initializes all I\/Os one time by means of the application. The application is named HiddenOnlineConfigModeApp . It is displayed in the device editor of the PLC on the Applications tab. You can use it to operate the I\/Os with the following functions as in normal online mode: Read I\/Os Write outputs Diagnosis (in the tree and on the status page) Scan (of the current hardware) Interactive online functions, if supported (for example, writing asynchronous messages) Writing and forcing in the I\/O mapping In online configuration mode, the writing and forcing of values in the I\/O Mapping dialog works differently to the way it works in real online mode. CODESYS writes the outputs into the I\/O mapping table immediately after being inserted. There is no Prepared Value column. Instead, you change the initial values directly after you double-click the Current Value column.

"body" : "Whether or not you can configure an I\/O mapping to project variables or even to the entire function blocks depends on the type of device. Configuring an I\/O map means linking input and output channels of the device with variables of the project. We also use the term \" mapping \" for this. Pay attention in general to the following for the mapping of inputs and outputs of a device to variables in CODESYS : You do not have write access to variables that are mapped to an input. You can map an existing variable to one input only. You can directly generate new global implicit variables in the I\/O map and map them to a device channel. The memory layout of structures is specified by the device. You can change addresses and fix values in the I\/O map. For each variable that is assigned to an I\/O channel in the Tab: <device name> I\/O Mapping dialog, you can cause \"force variables\" to be generated during the compilation of the application (see further below). Using these variables you can, for example during the commissioning of a plant, force a value on the input or output via a visualization\/HMI. Changes in the I\/O map can be transferred to the controller with an online change. If a pointer to a device input is used, the access is considered to be a write access, for example pTest := ADR(input); . When the code is generated, this leads to a compiler warning: \" ...invalid assignment target \". If you require a construct of this kind, you have to first copy the input value input to a variable with write access. An I\/O address can also be linked with a variable via the \"AT declaration\" in the IEC code. Since a device configuration often changes again, however, we recommend that you make the assignments only in the device editor. If you use the AT declaration, note the following: An AT declaration is permissible only with local or global variables, not with input or output variables of function blocks. Implicit \"force variables\" for I\/Os (see below) cannot be generated for AT declarations. If you use an AT declaration with structure variables or function block variables, all instances will access the same memory location. This then corresponds to the use of \"static variables\" in classic programming languages such as \"C\". If a pointer to a device input is used, then the access (for example, pTest := ADR(input); ) applies as write access. When the code is generated, this leads to a compiler warning: \" ...invalid assignment target \". If you require a construct of this kind, you have to first copy the input value ( input ) to a variable with write access. As an alternative, you can assign a variable to an address in the programming code using the AT declaration. In view of possible changes of the device configuration, however, we recommend that you make the assignments only in the device editor. You can export the I\/O mapping configuration of a device to a csv file or import it from such a file. For more information, see: Export mappings to CSVFor more information, see: Generating implicit variables for the forcing of I\/Os" },

"body" : "Requirement: A device that supports an I\/O mapping configuration in CODESYS is inserted in the device tree of your project. On the I\/O Mapping tab in the device editor you thus get a tabular display of the input and output channels of the device with specification of the addresses and data types. Mapping data types which are \"too large\" If a variable of a data type that is larger than a byte is mapped to a byte address, the value of the variable will be truncated to byte size there. For monitoring the variable value in the I\/O Mapping dialog, this means that, in the \"root\" element of the address, the value is displayed which the variable currently has in the project. The current individual bit values of the byte are displayed in succession in the bit elements below that, but this may not be sufficient for the entire variable value. If a UNION is represented by I\/O channels in the mapping dialog, it depends on the device whether mapping to the \"root\" element is also possible. In a POU, declare, for example, a variable xBool4 of the type BOOL with which you want to access an input of the target device from the application. To open the device editor, double-click the device object in the device tree, and then the <device name> I\/O Mapping tab. Observe the Variable column with the display of the device input channels and device output channels , which can still be sorted by organizational nodes, depending on the device. We assume that there is a device input of the type BYTE . It is displayed with its individual bit addresses (bit channels) below the BYTE node. Note: When mapping structured variables, the editor prevents you from entering both the structure variable (example: %QB0 ) and individual structure elements (example: %QB0.1 and QB0.2 ). Therefore, if there is a main entry with a subtree of bit channel entries in the mapping table, then the following applies: Then you can specify a variable either into the line of the main entry, or into the lines of the subelements (bit channels), but not into both. You can now occupy either the entire channel with a variable of a suitable type OR its individual bit-channel addresses with suitable variables of the type BOOL or BIT . First of all, double-click a bit input channel in the Variables column. An input field opens. In order to place an existing variable on the channel, you have to enter the desired project variable with the complete path. Press to open the Input Assistant. Select, for example, the variable Application.PLC_PRG.xBool4 declared in PLC_PRG . The variable is inserted. The symbol is displayed in the Mapping column. The address is now struck through. That does not mean that the address is no longer available, because values of existing variables are managed at another memory space. But: in order to avoid ambiguities when writing the values, you should nevertheless not occupy the address with a further variable, especially in the case of outputs. Note: For compiler version V3.5 SP11 and higher, the initialization value of the variables is used automatically as the default value when mapping to an existing variable. You can edit the Default value field only if you map to a new created variable or if no mapping is specified. In older versions, users had to specify explicitly that the default value and initialization value were identical. Delete the variable assignment again. Click the root of the channel, the BYTE node. Use the Input Assistant again to select the variable Application.PLC_PRG.byte_gotodevice . The variable is inserted, all bit addresses of the main channel are struck through and you should not additionally occupy them. " },

"body" : "Tasklocal variables are cycle-consistent. In a task cycle, they are written only by a defined task, while all other tasks have read-only access. It is taken into account that tasks can be interrupted by other tasks or can run simultaneously. The cycle consistency also applies above all if the application is running on a system with a multicore processor. Therefore, using task local global variable lists is one way to automatically achieve a synchronization (by the compiler) when multiple tasks are processing the same variables. This is not the case when using ordinary GVLs. Multiple tasks can write simultaneously to ordinary GVL variables during a cycle. However, it is imperative to note: The synchronization of tasklocal variables requires a relatively large amount of time and memory and is not always the best solution for every application. For this reason, see below for more detailed technical information and \"best practice\" guidance to help you make the right decision. In the CODESYS project, the Global Variable List (tasklocal) object is available for defining tasklocal variables. Syntactically, it corresponds to a normal GVL, but also contains the information of the task that has write access to the variables. Then all variables in such a GVL are not changed by another task during a cycle of a task. Tasklocal variables are complex variables whose value cannot be changed in online mode using the Write Values command. The next section contains a simple example that demonstrates the principle and functionality of tasklocal variables. It includes a writing program and a reading program. The programs run in different tasks, but they access the same data that is stored in a tasklocal global variable list so that they are processed cycle-consistently. " },

"body" : "The variables are located at a different address in the list for each task. For read access, this means: ADR(variable name) yields a different address in each task. The synchronization mechanism guarantees the following: Cycle consistency Freedom from locked states: A task never waits for an action from another task at any time. With this method, however, no time can be determined when a reading task securely receives a copy of the writing task. Fundamentally, the copies can deviate. In the example above, it cannot be concluded that each written copy is processed one time by the reader. For example, the reading task can edit the same array over multiple cycles, or the contents of the array can skip one or more values between two cycles. Both can occur and have to be considered. The writing task can be paused for one cycle between two accesses to the shared reference by each reading task. This means that when n reading tasks exist, the writing task can have n cycles of delay until the next update of the shared reference. In each task, the writing task can prevent a reading task from getting a reading copy. As a result, no maximum number of cycles can be specified after which a reading task will definitely receive a copy. In particular, this can become problematic if very slow running tasks are involved. Assuming a task runs only every hour and cannot access the tasklocal variables during this time, then the task works with a very old copy of the list. Therefore, it can be useful to insert a timestamp in the tasklocal variables so that the reading tasks can at least determine whether or not the list is up-to-date. You can set a timestamp as follows: Add a variable of type LTIME to the list of tasklocal variables and add the following code to the writing task, for example: tasklocal.g_timestamp := LTIME(); .

"body" : "Tasklocal variables are designed for the \"Single writer – multiple readers\" use case. When you implement a code that is called by different tasks, using tasklocal variables is a significant advantage. For example, this is the case for the sample application appTasklocal as described above when it is extended by multiple reading tasks that all access the same array and use the same functions. Tasklocal variables are especially useful on multicore systems. On these systems, you cannot synchronize tasks by priority. Then other synchronization mechanisms become necessary. Do not use tasklocal variables when a reading task always has to work on the newest copy of the variable. Tasklocal variables are not suitable for this purpose. A similar issue is the \"Producer–Consumer\" dilemma. This happens when a task produces data and another task processes the data. Choose another type of synchronization for this configuration. For example, the producer could use a flag to notify that a new date exists. Then the consumer can use a second flag to notify that it has processed its data and is waiting for new input. In this way, both can work on the same data. This removes the overhead for cyclic copying of data, and the consumer does not lose any data generated by the producer. " },

"body" : "For a list of tasklocal variables, the compiler creates a copy for each task, as well as a shared reference copy for all tasks. This creates a structure that contains the same variables as the list of tasklocal variables. Moreover, an array with this structure is created in which an array dimension is created for each task. As a result, an array element is indexed for each task. If a variable in the list is accessed now in the code, then the tasklocal copy of the list is actually accessed. Furthermore, it is determined in which task the block is currently running and the access is indexed accordingly. For example, the line of code diValue := TaskLocals.g_diaData[0]; from the above example is replaced by: diValue := __TaskLocalVarsArray[__CURRENTTASK.TaskIndex].__g_diarr[0]; The __CURRENTTASK operator is available in CODESYS V3.5 SP13 and higher in order to quickly determine the current task index. At runtime, at the end of the writing task, the contents of the tasklocal list are written to the global list. For a reading task at the beginning, the contents of the shared reference are copied to the tasklocal copy. Therefore, for n tasks, there are n+1 copies of the list: One list serves as a shared reference and every task also has its own copy of the list. A scheduler controls the time-based execution of multiple tasks and therefore also task switching. The strategy, which is tracked by the scheduler in order to control the allocation of the execution time, has the goal of preventing a task from being blocked. The synchronization mechanism is therefore optimized to the properties of tasklocal variables to prevent blocking states (lock states) and at no time does a task wait for the action of another task. Synchronization strategy: As long as the writing task writes a copy back to the shared reference, none of the reading tasks gets a copy. As long as a reading task gets a copy of the common reference, the writing task does not write back a copy. " },

For more information, see the following: IF pragma with project_defined (<global define>)In the implementation of a POU Structured Text (ST) In the ST implementation language, a pragma belongs to a “statement position”. A valid position is at the beginning of the implementation on a separate line. Another valid position is labeled after a statement ending with a semicolon \" ; \" or by keywords such as END_VAR , END_IF , or END_WHILE . Function Block Diagram (FBD) or Ladder Diagram (LD) In the implementation languages of the FBD\/LD\/IL editor, a pragma belongs at a position which is also suitable for a label. You can enter the pragma just like a label. To do this, select the command FBD\/LD\/IL → Insert Label . Then, in the text field of the label, replace the default text Label: with the desired pragma. To use a pragma in addition to a label, you specify the pragma first and then the label.

"body" : "With the CODESYS C code integration, modules developed in C can be integrated as a library into a CODESYS project. The module is stored as a dynamic runtime module in a library along with the IEC interface which is implemented in it. Moreover, multiple variants of a module for different target systems may be stored in a library. The library is displayed to the user like any other IEC 61131-3 library. When the library is used in an application, then CODESYS automatically downloads the suitable module from the library to the controller and executes it from the CODESYS Control runtime system. Application examples: Reuse of existing C code Integration of code generated by modeling tools, such as Matlab®\/Simulink® Dynamic integration of device-specific functions created in C code All dynamic modules of an application are transferred and loaded to the runtime system during the download. The runtime system must support dynamic linking for this. License for the runtime system The runtime system requires a license that permits C modules to be loaded. Without this license, dynamic modules cannot be linked during the download, and therefore the download will be aborted. The dynamic modules are part of the boot application and they are reloaded and activated when the controller is restarted. The Reset Origin command unloads all C code modules in the application. The Reset Cold and Reset Warm commands do not lead to a repeated initialization of the C code modules. CODESYS does not support the monitoring of variables in C code files or the setting of breakpoints in C source code. Assigning precompiled runtime modules to devices and saving them in libraries Requirement: A library ( *.library ) is open in CODESYS . Click View → POUs . The POUs view opens and displays the library project and its objects. Select the library project and click Project → Add Object → C-Implemented Library . Click Add in the Add C-Implemented Library dialog. CODESYS adds the C-Implemented Library object to the POUs view. Double-click the C-Implemented Library object. The object opens in its editor Click Add in this editor. The Select Device dialog opens. In the Object file input field, specify the name of a dynamically loadable module in the format *.dll or *.so . The *.dll file has to contain the title of the library project in its name. Example: If the library project is named XYlib , then the Object File has to be named: <name>_XYlib.dll In the Device window, select a device for assignment of the Object file . Click Select Device . CODESYS displays the created device file assignment in the editor on the Compiled Components tab. Save the library project. For more information see: C Implemented Library" },

"body" : "You use the \"variable configuration\" to map variables of functions blocks to the process image. For declarations in the function block, you assign the variables to the device inputs\/outputs without providing the full address. Then, the exact address is provided centrally for all function block instances of the application in a global variable list including VAR_CONFIG declarations. This global variable list with the VAR_CONFIG declarations is called the variable configuration. For changes to variables that are assigned to I\/O addresses, CODESYS displays them immediately in the process image. For changes to variables that are mapped by a variables configuration, CODESYS displays them only at the end of the responsible task. Declaration of variables in functions blocks When declaring variables in a function block, you declare the variables between the keywords VAR and END_VAR and assign incomplete addresses to the variables. In doing so, you assign incomplete addresses to the variables. You mark these incomplete addresses with an asterisk ( * ). Syntax: <identifier> AT %<I\\|Q>*:<data type>; Example You define two local I\/O variables: the input variable xLocIn and the output variable xLocOut . FUNCTION_BLOCK locio\nVAR\n xLocIn AT %I*: BOOL := TRUE;\n xLocOut AT %Q*: BOOL;\nEND_VAR The final definition of the addresses is performed in the variable configuration in a global variable list. In the global variable list that you use as the variable configuration, you define the variable declarations with the absolute addresses between the VAR_CONFIG and END_VAR keywords. You must declare the VAR_CONFIG variables with the complete instance path, separating the individual POU and instance name by a dot. The declaration has to include an address whose class (input\/output) matches the class of the incomplete address (%I*, %Q*) in the function block. The data type also has to match. Syntax: <instance variable path> AT %<I\\|Q><location>: <data type>; If the path instance does not exist, then an error is reported. CODESYS issues an error also if there is not an address configuration available for a variable that you declared with an incomplete address. Example The locio function block in the example above is used in a program as follows: PROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n locioVar1: locio;\n locioVar2: locio;\nEND_VAR A correct variable configuration in a global variable list could then look like this: VAR_CONFIG\n PLC_PRG.locioVar1.xLocIn AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;\n PLC_PRG.locioVar1.xLocOut AT %QX0.0 : BOOL;\n PLC_PRG.locioVar2.xLocIn AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;\n PLC_PRG.locioVar2.xLocOut AT %QX0.3 : BOOL;\nEND_VAR " },

The following is included in the calculation: The calculation starts with the implicit POU for the entry of the task. For each IEC program call (e.g. PLC_PRG ), the stack usage of each IEC POU called is calculated recursively. The largest possible stack usage of a POU is added to its own local stack usage in order to determine the maximum stack usage of the POU. For dynamic calls, the stack usage is calculated as follows: The stack usage of all possible implementations is determined and the largest stack usage is assumed. This means that all possible implementations are taken into account for interface methods and all possible overrides for function block methods. The value specified by the target device is assumed for external calls. If the device has not specified a value, then 0 is assumed. In the case of recursion, the calculation is aborted. The value of the type attribute pragma estimated-stack-usage is applied for the recursively called code. If no value is specified,then 0 is assumed. The stack usage is therefore only an estimate.

"body" : "The assignment of task and CPU core is displayed in the Task Configuration object on the Tab: Task Groups tab. More and more of today's controllers have processors with multiple CPU cores. If CODESYS is executed on a multicore controller without using the multicore feature, then the distribution of tasks is handled by the scheduler of the operating system. This is true provided that an application is executed with multiple tasks. In this case, you have no direct influence over the distribution of tasks. Depending on the load balancing, the tasks can also run on different CPU cores. With the CODESYS Multicore feature, the IEC tasks themselves can be assigned to dedicated CPU cores, taking the acquired number of CPU cores into account. This can result in improved performance. The IEC program should be split into several tasks for this purpose. There are two basic different strategies in CODESYS for distributing IEC tasks over CPU cores: IEC task which is linked and fixed to a CPU core: The task is always executed on this specific CPU core. Multiple tasks can be linked to a CPU core by grouping. This is useful, for example, if the IEC program is not yet able to run on multiple CPU cores simultaneously. The IEC task is executed on all CPU cores: The operating system takes control of distributing one or more tasks of a group on the CPU cores. When the IEC tasks are distributed over CPU cores, some changes result in the behavior in the IEC program, which have to be considered. The processing of IEC tasks by priority is no longer a given. They are processed by priority only if the tasks are bundled together to one CPU core. The cycle consistency of the data in the IEC task with the highest priority is no longer a given. Therefore, the data has to be copied locally at the beginning of the IEC task cycle if the values should not change during the cycle. For all tasks, there is a shared process image from which the tasks operate. The ReadInputs() function is called at the start of each task and the WriteOutputs() function is called at the end. As a result, the IPO model applies for each task individually. These functions read and write to the shared process image. The process image is also physically written and the packets transmitted only when the bus cycle task is called. However, the bus cycle task waits for each call of WriteOutputs and ReadInputs of the tasks. This ensures the data consistency within the bus cycle task. Outputs can be assigned only to one task. Inputs can be assigned to multiple tasks, but direct access should be avoided. The inputs have to be written to local variables of the task by means of atomic operations. A second task, which updates the process image with ReadInputs() in parallel to the first task, also updates the inputs of the first task while it is running. As a result, the data consistency of a task is ensured only on single cores for the highest priority task. You can set the bus cycle task on the PLC Settings tab. You can display the I\/O access on the Tab: Task Deployment tab. For more information, see: Bus Cycle TaskFor consistent counters (incrementer, decrementer), the atomic external library function SysCpuAtomicAdd() should always be used (for more details, see SysCpuHandling.library ). Data consistency Bit access (data type BIT ) is not processed consistently (atomically) on multicore CPUs in the IEC program. For this we recommend that you use the external library function SysCpuTestAndSetBit() . (For details, see: SysCpuHandling.library ) Simple data types up to a width of 32 bits ( BOOL , BYTE , WORD \/ INT , DWORD \/ DINT , etc.) are processed consistently (atomically) in the IEC program on multicore CPUs as well. Data types with 64 bits ( LINT , LWORD , and LREAL ) are processed consistently (atomically) in the IEC program on 64-bit systems and multicore systems only. To do this, you do not need to take any precautions. To access complex data types ( STRING , FB , STRUCT , and ARRAY ), you need to make arrangements yourself for the synchronization\/consistency. In the task configuration, on the Variable Usage tab, you can define whether a variable in an IEC task has read or write access. On multicore systems, a \"memory reordering effect\" can occur. For more information, see: IEC Operator: __MemoryBarrier() . Displaying the processor load per processor core in the trace In CODESYS , you can display in a visualization the processor load in a DeviceTrace object.

"body" : "Editing the variable list in the persistence editor causes the variable list to be edited automatically before it is saved, not to be saved as it is shown in the editor. During post-processing, a variable that you have removed is replaced by a placeholder variable with the same memory requirement. As a result, the subsequent variables retain their addresses in the process image. Moreover, a variable you add is moved to the end of the list. Post-processing can neutralize changes that would lead to a loss of persistence. But you create gaps that use additional memory. When loading the application, the CRC value of the variable list and the length of the list (number of variables) are stored on the controller. When loading the application again, the new test value is compared with the test value currently on the controller. Then the variable list is compared successively up to the specified length. If you have edited a declaration (for example, the name or data type), then the variable is reinitialized. Otherwise its value is retained. When the application is loaded again, CODESYS checks whether the variable list declared in the persistence editor is still consistent with the variable list already on the controller. The mechanism works well when the variables themselves are not modified significantly. Too extensive changes of the identifiers and the data types continue to lead to a reinitialization and the loss of persistence. If you anticipate frequent changes due to your application requirements, then this kind of a list is not recommended. Moreover, in an online change after a data type change, a persistent variable is less robust than a variable with a normal lifespan. It is good practice to clear any gaps in the variable list after a while ( Reorder List and Clear Gaps command). After cleaning, however, the list no longer matches the list on the controller and you have triggered an initialization of all persistent variables. The persistence of all variables is lost.

Hint: You have the following support when overwriting methods, actions, attributes, and transitions that are inherited by the base block.

"body" : "Implementing interfaces is based on the concept of object-oriented programming. With common interfaces, you can use different but similar function blocks the same way. A function block that implements an interface has to include all methods and properties that are defined in that interface (interface methods and interface properties). This means that the name and the inputs and outputs of the methods or attributes must be exactly the same. When you create a new function block which implements an interface, CODESYS automatically adds all methods and attributes of the interface to the tree below the new function block. If you add more interface methods afterwards, then CODESYS does not automatically add these methods to the affected function block. To perform this update, you must execute the Implement Interfaces command explicitly. For inherited function blocks, you have to make sure that any methods or attributes that were derived through the \"inheritance\" of an interface also receive the appropriate implementation. Otherwise they should be deleted in case the implementation that was provided in the basis should be used. Respective compile error messages or warnings are displayed, prompted automatically by added pragma attributes. For more information, see the help page for the Implementing Interfaces command. You must assign the interface of a function block to a variable of the interface type before a method can be called via the variable. A variable of the interface type is always a reference of the assigned function block instance. A variable of the interface type is a reference to instances of function blocks. This kind of variable can refer to every function block that implements the interface. If there is no assignment to a variable, then the variable in online mode contains the value 0 . Examples The I1 interface contains the GetName method. METHOD GetName : STRING The functions blocks A and B implements the interface I1 : FUNCTION_BLOCK A IMPLEMENTS I1\nFUNCTION_BLOCK B IMPLEMENTS I1 For this reason, both function blocks must include a method named GetName and the return type STRING . Otherwise the compiler reports an error. A function includes the declaration of a variable of interface I1 type. FUNCTION DeliverName : STRING\nVAR_INPUT\n l_i : I1;\nEND_VAR Function blocks that implement the I1 interface can be assigned to these input variables. Examples of function calls: DeliverName(l_i := A_instance); \/\/ call with instance of type A\nDeliverName(l_i := B_instance); \/\/ call with instance of type B Calling of interface methods: In this case, it depends on the actual type of l_i whether the application calls A.GetName or B.GetName .

Therefore, avoid extensive routing tables, complex calculations or queries at runtime. Construct the control network hierarchically. Each node may possess a parent node and any number of child nodes. A node without a parent is a \"top level\" node. Cycles are not permitted, i.e. each control network has the structure of a tree. Parent-child relationships results from the specification of certain network areas. A network area can be, for example, a local Ethernet or a serial point-to-point connection. We differentiate between the main network (mainnet) and the subnetworks (subnet). Each node belongs at the most to one main network, to which its parent node, if one exists, also belongs. For each node any desired number of subnets can be configured, for which the node acts in each case as a parent. A network area may have only one parent node. Therefore, a configuration in which a network area is defined at the same time as a subnet of several nodes is invalid. " },

"body" : "Addressing means: the topology of the control network is mapped to unique addresses. A node address is composed hierarchically: For each network connection the associated block driver determines a local address, which uniquely identifies the node within the local network. The full node address is formed as follows: The local address is prepended to the subnet index of the local network assigned by the parent. In turn, the subnet index is placed in front of the node address of the parent. The length of the subnet index (in bits) is thereby determined by the device. The length of the local address, conversely, is determined by the type of network. A node without a main network is a top level node with address 0. A node with a main network that contains no parent is likewise a top level node. It is given the local address of the main network. See an example of a control network here: In the example the addresses of the nodes are represented in hexadecimal notation. The first 4 digits represent the address of the respective parent in the main network, for example 0x007A=122 for PLC1 . The next byte (in blue fonts) is reserved for the subnet index and is followed by the local address (example: C=12 for Node-ID 12 ). The structuring of the addresses makes a lean routing algorithm possible. Routing tables, for example, are thus unnecessary. Information is queried only locally: via its own address and via the address of the parent node. On this basis a node can correctly process the data packages: If the destination address corresponds to the address of the current node, then this is meant to be the receiver. If the destination address starts with the address of the current node, then the data package is either meant directly for a child or for a descendant of the node and must be forwarded. In all other cases the receiver is not a descendant of the current node and the data package must be forwarded to its own parent. Relative addressing is a special case: Relative addresses do not contain the node number of the receiver, but directly describe the path from the sender to the receiver. The principle is similar to the relative path in the file system: The address consists of the number of steps by which the package has to be transported upwards. These are the steps to the corresponding parent and from the subsequent path downwards to the destination node. The advantage of relative addressing is that two nodes in the same subtree can continue to communicate if the complete subtree is shifted to another place in the entire network. Whereas the absolute node addressing has to be modified due to this shift, the relative addressing is still valid. Address determination For a node to know its own address it must either know the address of its parent node or know that it is a top level node. For this purpose the node dispatches a message during the bootup to all network devices for address determination. As long as it receives no response to this message, the node considers itself to be a top level node, but continues to search for a possible parent. A parent node responds by announcing its address. The node will thus independently complete its address and will announce it to the subnets. An address determination can be accomplished during the bootup or at the request of the PC used for programming. " },

This mapping is performed by the corresponding block driver. The first three bytes of the IP address are identical for all network devices within an Ethernet network with \"Class C\" IP addresses. Consequently, the last 8 bits of the IP address suffice as network address, since they enable unambiguous mapping between the two addresses on the block driver. A node has a different network address for each network connection. Different network connections can have the same network address, since each address need only be locally unique. Terminology: The network address in the main network is usually designated as the network address of a node with no specification of the network connection. The length of a network address is specified in bits and can be chosen by the block driver as required. The same length must be used for all nodes within a network area. A network address is represented by an array of bytes in accordance with the following coding: Length of the network address: n bits Required bytes: b = (n + 7) DIV 8 The (n MOD 8) bits of lowest rank of the first byte and all others (n DIV 8) are used for the network address.

"body" : "The node address indicates the absolute address of a node within a control network and is therefore unique within the whole \"network tree\". The address is composed of up to 15 address components, each of which occupies 2 bytes. The lower a node is located within the network hierarchy, the longer its address. The complete node address consists of the partial addresses of all preceding nodes and the partial address of the node itself. Each partial address consists of one or more address components. The length is therefore always a multiple of 2 bytes. The partial address of a node is formed from the network address of the node in its main network and the subnet index of the main network in the case of the parent node. The bits required for the subindex are determined by the router of the parent node. Filler bits can be inserted between the subnet index and the network address in order to ensure that the length of the partial address is a multiple of 2 bytes. Special cases: Node without network: This means that there is neither a subnet index nor a network address in the main network. In this case the address is set to 0x0000. Node in main network without parent: In this case, a subnet index with 0 length is assumed. The partial address corresponds to the network address, if necessary extended by filler bits. Example of node addresses The node address is always specified in hexadecimal. The individual address components (two bytes in each case) are separated by a colon \":\". Since this represents an array of bytes and not a 16-bit value, the components are not displayed in the Intel format. For manually input addresses, missing parts in an address component are supplemented by leading zeros: \" 274 \" = \" 0274 \". In order to improve the legibility, the display should also always contain the leading zeros. Absolute and relative addresses Communication between two nodes can be based on relative or absolute addresses. Absolute addresses are identical to node addresses. Relative addresses specify a path from the sender to the receiver. They consist of an address offset and the descending path to the receiver. The (negative) address offset describes the number of address components by which a package must be passed upwards in the tree before it can be passed back down by the common parent node. Since nodes can use partial addresses that consist of more than one component, the number of parent components to be passed is always equal to the address offset. This means that the demarcation between the parent nodes is no longer clear. For that reason the common start of the address of the communication partners is used as the parent address. Each address component is counted as an upward step, independent of the current parent node. Each error resulting from this assumption can be detected by the corresponding parent node and must be handled by it accordingly. After reaching the common parent node the relative path, as an array of address components, is followed downwards as usual. Formally: The node address of the receiver is formed by removing the last address offset components from the node address of the sender and by appending the relative path to the remaining address. Example of the formation of node addresses In the following example each address component is represented by a letter; in each case a dot separates nodes from each other. Since a node can carry several address components, there are some in the example that are represented with several letters. Node A: a.bc.d.ef.g Node B: a.bc.i.j.kl.m Address of the least common parent: a.bc Relative address from A to B: -4\/i.j.kl.m The number 4 results from the 4 components – d , e , f and g – which has to forward the data package in the upwards. In order to guarantee correct operation of the routing, the relative address must be adapted each time it passes an intermediate node. It is sufficient to adapt the address offset. This is always done by the parent node. If a node receives a data package from one of its subnets, the address offset is increased by the length of the address component of this subnet. If the new address offset is < 0, then the data package must be passed further upward. If the address offset is >= 0, then the data package must be passed on to the child node whose local address corresponds to the relative path, starting from the address offset. First of all, however, the address offset must be increased by the length of the local address of the child node, so that the child node sees the correct address. A special situation results if the error mentioned above occurs during the determination of the common parent node. In this case the address offset of the actual parent node is negative, but this value is larger than the length of the partial address of the subnet from which the package originated. So that the next node sees a correct relative address in this case, the relevant node has to do the following: discover the error, calculate the local address of the child node on the basis of the address of the predecessor node and the length difference, and adapt the address offset accordingly. In this case, too, the address components as such remain unchanged; only the offset is changed. " },

"body" : "The values of network variables can be exchanged between different PLCs in a network. The variables have to be defined in rigid, identical lists in both the transmitter device and the receiver device, where only one application of a device may defined network variables. The lists can be in one or more projects. The network variable list in the sender is a global variable list where specific log and transfer parameters are defined in their object properties. By adding these properties, you create a \"network variable list (sender)\" from an ordinary GVL . You can also insert a Network Variable List (Sender) object directly into the device tree when this object already has these parameters set. The network variable list in the receiver is a Network Variable List (Receiver) type. When creating one, select the respective network variable list of the server. As an alternative, you can read this variable list from an export file that was generated from the sender list. An export file is required anyway for defining the sender list in another project. The network variables are transmitted as broadcasting in one direction only: sender to receiver. However, it is also possible for a device to contain both sender and receiver lists. For the NetVarUdp library version 3.5.7.0 and higher, a receiver channel is no longer assigned when confirmed transfer is not selected. As a result, network variable exchange is also possible between two controllers on one hardware device. If the exchanging devices should be senders and receivers, then the variable list identifiers must be unique in order to prevent abnormal operation. The variable list identifiers are defined in the Properties dialog of a GVL object. Data exchange via network variables is not possible when: If the device (target system) does not support it A firewall blocks the communication. If another client or application is using the UDP port which is set in the properties of the network variable list If more than one application per sender device and receiver device use network variable lists Only arrays that have limits defined with a literal or constant are transmitted to the receiver application. Constant expressions are not permitted for this purpose. Example: \" arrVar : ARRAY[0..g_iArraySize-1] OF INT ; \" is not transmitted, but \" arrVar : ARRAY[0..10] OF INT ; \" is transmitted. The maximum size of a network variable is 255 bytes. The possible number of network variables is unlimited. If the size of the GVL exceeds the maximum length of the network telegram, then the data is split into multiple telegrams. Depending on the configuration, this can lead to data inconsistencies. During data transmission via UDP from the sender to the receiver, data can be lost in each cycle at the following positions or events: Sender (network driver, - stack) Router Switch Network collisions Receiver (network driver, - stack) This means that the data received by the receiver in a cycle may not be up-to-date, but outdated. Communication by means of network variables is also possible when the PLCs operated with applications from different versions of the development system (V2.3, V3 ). However, in this case, you cannot use the export\/import mechanism for matching the variable lists exactly in the sender and receiver projects. The reason is that an variable export file ( *.exp ) that is generated from V2.3 does not include the required amount of information necessary for creating a receiving NVL in V3 . There is no respective network parameter configuration as a GVL file, which you exported from the sender previously. To get this file, you must recreate the V2.3 NVL in V3 first. Then you can generate an export file and create a receiving NVL in V3 based on this. An alternate to data exchange between PLCs is the use of data sources. As opposed to the broadcasting method for exchanging network variables, defined point-to-point connections are created between one application and a remote data source.

"body" : "When you generate the application code, CODESYS outputs information about memory allocation in the message view. Gaps form in the memory because reallocation is only for new and changed POUs and variables due to the incremental memory build. Online changes have the same effect. This fragmentation reduces the amount of available memory. However, you can completely reallocate the memory by clicking Clean and therefore increase the amount of free memory. Syntax errors and bugs which CODESYS detects during the code generation and memory allocation are also output in the message view ( Build category). Output information about memory allocation: Size of the generated code (in bytes): Sum of all code segments Size of global data (in bytes): Total memory used by the global variables. Inputs and outputs are not included unless inputs or outputs are mapped in the area of the global variables. Total allocated memory size for code and data (in bytes): The total allocated memory is composed of the already used memory areas plus the reserved, not yet used memory for incremental builds and online changes. After the first build, the already used memory is approximately equal to the highest used address (see below). The largest contiguous memory gap (see below) still corresponds approximately to the difference to the total allocated memory. However, as the number of incremental builds and online changes increases, the number of memory gaps also increases, and the largest contiguous memory gap becomes smaller. Memory area <n> : Contents of the individual reserved memory areas: Background: It depends on the PLC which data and code is stored in which memory areas. For example, code and data are located in the same area on the CODESYS Control Win . For the addresses %I , %M , and %Q , memory is always reserved, even when a variable is not assigned to an address. After \"cleaning\" the application, the memory is reallocated completely. In this case, small gaps could result from the predefined \"alignment\" (normally 8). Larger gaps result from changing a date without \"cleaning\", for example by increasing an array area. In this case, only the affected POUs are recompiled. Furthermore, in the case of an online change, the memory is used only for new variables and new code. Memory that was previously reserved by deleted variables and code is made available again. As a result, memory fragmentation can occur after many incremental builds and online changes. This creates many small gaps that might not be usable at all in some cases. To clarify how much memory is safely available, the \"largest contiguous memory gap\" of the memory area is output during code generation. Highest used address (Byte) : This is the highest reserved address in the entire allocated memory area. During the first build after a \"cleaning\" operation, the memory addresses are output to variables in ascending order, taking into consideration the alignment (usually 8 bytes). As a result, the highest address used at this time corresponds approximately to the amount of memory used. The rest of the allocated memory area is still completely available for incremental builds and online changes. Largest contiguous memory gap (in bytes): This is the memory size that is available for backup. Resulting gaps in the allocated memory are reused whenever possible for other changes. When, for example, a global variable of type Byte is added, it is placed in the first free byte of the memory. Even just a small gap is enough for this. However, an FB instance, a variable of the type structure or array, or the code for a POU has to be stored contiguously and therefore occupies more memory accordingly. As a result, they can be allocated only to the largest contiguous memory area. This is why during code generation the \"largest contiguous memory gap\" that is safely available is output (in bytes), as well as its percentage of the total memory. For this, see also: Options for generating applications " },

You can set breakpoints at specific positions in the program to force an execution stop and to monitor variable values. You can set special \"data breakpoints\" to halt program execution when the value of a specific variable changes. The halt at a breakpoint or data breakpoint can be linked to additional conditions. You can also redefine breakpoints and data breakpoints as \"execution points\" where specific code is executed instead of stopping the program. The Breakpoints view provides an overview of all defined breakpoints. It also includes additional commands for processing batch changes to multiple breakpoints. In the editor, the following symbols identify the status of a breakpoint or execution point: : The breakpoint is enabled. : The breakpoint is disabled. : The breakpoint is set in another instance of the POU open in the editor. : The program halts at the breakpoint. : The breakpoint with condition is enabled. : The breakpoint with condition is disabled. : The execution point is enabled. : The execution point is disabled. : The execution point with condition is enabled. : The execution point with condition is disabled. : The data breakpoint is enabled. : The data breakpoint is disabled. : The program halts at the data breakpoint. : The data execution point is enabled. : The data execution point is disabled. : The program halts at the data execution point. : The data execution point with condition is enabled. : The data breakpoint with condition is enabled.

In the Breakpoints view, select the line with the data breakpoint and click the button. The line is marked and identified by the symbol (data breakpoint enabled). When the program reaches the data breakpoint (meaning when the value of the selected variables changes), the program processing halts. In the implementation part of the POU, the next line is identified by an arrow . This is identified in the status line by the HALT ON BP status highlighted in red.

"body" : "With flow control, you can monitor the processing of the application program. Flow control is provided for the ST, FBD, LD, and CFC language editors. With an activated flow control, CODESYS displays the variable values and results from function calls and operations at the respective processing location and time. In this way, the exact lines of code and networks that process the current cycle are marked in colors. Compare this to standard monitoring, in which CODESYS delivers only the value that a variable has between two processing cycles. Flow control works in all parts of the editor view that are currently visible. Flow control enabled is then displayed in the status line as long as the function is active and flow control positions (processed parts of code) are visible in an editor view. You can write values in the declaration part and implementation part. Forcing is not possible. Values are written at the end of the current cycle. When you enable flow control , the cycle time of the application is prolonged. When Confirmed Online Mode is selected in the communication settings, a dialog prompt appears when switching on the flow control to cancel the operation. When flow control is enabled, it is not possible to use breakpoints or to step through the program. Display of the flow control in different language editors: By default, CODESYS displays the flow control positions of the processed parts of code as green fields. Unprocessed parts of code are displayed in white. Note that the displayed value of an unprocessed code position is a \"normal\" monitoring value. This is the value between two task cycles. In network editors, CODESYS marks the processed networks with bars on the left edge in the \"flow control color\". In LD, CODESYS displays the currently processed connecting lines in green and all others in gray. The actual value of the connection is also displayed: TRUE by a bold blue line, FALSE by a bold black line, and unknown or analog values by thin black lines. Combinations of these lines are displayed as dashed lines. In IL, for each statement CODESYS uses two fields for the display of the actual values. One is located to the left of the operator with the current accumulator value, and one is located to the right of the operand with the operand value. " },

At runtime, the state of an application or facility can become sensitive and disruptive actions can endanger the entire machine or facility. However, in this state you can suppress certain commands and prevent dangerous actions. The PlcOperationControl function block and Component Manager library are provided for this purpose. Examples of CODESYS commands which can suppress operations when executed: Online Change , Download Enable Breakpoint Reset Application , Stop Application Transmit Data Force Values , Write Values The Reset Origin Device command cannot be deactivated so that you cannot completely lock yourself out of the runtime system. This command is the last option for opening a completely locked runtime system where all critical operations are deactivated. This is usually acceptable because this command requires extended permissions in the device user management. CODESYS will notify you if a currently disabled runtime service is required at application runtime. Then, you can respond with an appropriate countermeasure. " },

They trigger the passing of the <arg1> … <argn> arguments to the script. The arguments are passed to the Python variable sys.argv . --noUI Use this option with the --runscript option. The CODESYS user interface is not opened. CODESYS outputs all errors, warnings, compiler reports, and command-line messages generated from the script. The script messages (1: Severity Text) can be separated from other messages (2: Severity FatalError, Error, Warning, Information) with the > operator. --enablescripttracing Use this option with the --runscript option. As a result, each command of the script file is shown in the output. --textPrompts Use this option with the --noUI option.

"body" : "In order to be able to use POUs, which are provided in a library POU, in the application, the library has to be integrated in the Library Manager in the project. The requirement for this is the installation of the library in the library repository. The Library Manager displays all integrated libraries according to their library type and the respective properties. In the Library Manager, you can add more libraries from the library repository, remove libraries, and edit library properties. The Library Manager can be inserted into the POUs view or the Devices view. As a result, a project can have a Library Manager for each application, as well as a Library Manager in the POUs view for use across all applications. The library POUs of the integrated libraries in the POUs view can be called regardless of the application. The library POUs of the integrated libraries in the Devices view can be called in the respective application code only. Furthermore, placeholder libraries behave differently when downloading depending on their positions. Libraries that are integrated to a specific version in the project also have a placeholder for that version (placeholder library). You can define special placeholder resolutions. You can also use the placeholder resolution that is defined for a device in the device description or that is stored in the library repository for a library. The Library Manager notifies you about the actual placeholder resolution and shows the version that will be loaded when an application is downloaded (effective version). When a Library Manager in the POUs view is integrated across all applications, you can access its contents globally. If placeholder libraries are integrated, then only the placeholder resolutions in the device description or library repository are checked. A Library Manager is usually integrated in the Devices view. Then only the application code below it calls library POUs from it. Moreover, the special placeholder resolutions are checked first for placeholder libraries. Only after that are the placeholder resolutions checked that are in the device description or that originate from the library repository. " },

"body" : "In order to avoid consistency problems and to adequately support the user, be sure to adhere to certain rules for the creation, referencing, encryption, protection, and documentation of libraries. The following description provides only an overview of the library development possibilities. For a more detailed description of these topics, see the \"LibDevSummary\" guidelines for library development. For more information, see: Using LibrariesGeneral You can define categories for libraries. The libraries are then displayed in the library repository below these categories. For more information about creating library categories, see: Library Categories You can define a namespace for a library in order to enable unambiguous access to the integrated objects. The access becomes unambiguous by adding the namespace in front of the POU name: <namespace>.<variable name> Example: AC.Module You can open the POUs of unencrypted libraries ( *.library ) by double-clicking the respective entry in the Library Manager. You can create the following library types: *.library : Implementation library (source code of the library) * .compiled-library , *.compiled-library-v3 : Protected library The source code is no longer accessible. *_Itfs.library : Interface library Contains only objects that are used for the interface definition of a component (for example, constants, structures, or interfaces) and do not generate any code *_Cnt.library : Container library Does not contain POUs, but only other libraries Therefore, used to conveniently integrate an entire set of libraries whose POUs are published on the top level of the container library You can integrate external libraries into the application. External libraries are programmed outside of CODESYS in a different programming language (example: C). Protection of libraries Source code protection When a library is prepared in \"compiled-library\" format, the source code of the library POUs is no longer visible after the library is integrated into a project. Signing In CODESYS V3 SP15 and higher, a certificate is always used for the signing of library projects ( *.compiled-library-v3 ). The signing can be enforced by means of a setting in the security screen. Then for generating a compiled library, you need a certificate suitable for code signing in your user profile. For library projects that have to be compatible with CODESYS < V3 SP15 ( *.compiled-library ), only the less safe signing is possible with a private key and a corresponding token. These deprecated methods should only be used for reasons of compatibility. Settings are configured in the Project Information on the Signing tab. Note: For signing libraries, you should use compiler version 3.5.15.0 or higher because a better storage format is used. Licensing You can protect libraries by means of a license (dongle or soft container). License-protected libraries can be installed in the library repository. However, for use in the project, the valid license has to exist on the computer. Licenses are managed in the License Manager. Library versions You can have several versions of a library installed on the system at the same time. You can have several versions of a library integrated into your project at the same time. However, we do not recommend doing this. In this case, each of the libraries must be assigned a unique namespace and access to the symbols must be qualified. Examples: V1.SendBlob , V2.SendBlob Referenced libraries You can integrate a library into other libraries (referenced libraries). The nesting can be of any depth. You can define whether referenced libraries should be visible in the Library Manager. You can integrate referenced libraries via library placeholders. This way you avoid the problems that could occur due to version dependencies or the necessity to use vendor-specific libraries. " },

You get licenses for these products from CODESYS GmbH in the form of ticket numbers, which you can install using the CODESYS License Manager. The License Manager stores the licensing information on an external USB device ( CODESYS dongle) or in a soft container which is registered in the local CodeMeter Control Center . The dongle has to be plugged in to your local PC. In the license repository , you can get the current information for each ticket number from the central license server. Other information is also provided, such as whether a license can still be activated or must be returned. There are plug-ins which require a license, but they can still be used with limited functionality even without a license. In such cases, messages about the missing license are displayed at locations which are specific to the plug-in. Examples of plug-ins like this (add-ons): CODESYS Git , CODESYS SVN , CODESYS UML from the Professional Developer Edition. Network licenses : A license registered in the local CodeMeter Control Center can be provided as a network license. To do this, the local computer is configured as a network server which authorized users can access and use the license.

If the profile includes plug-ins which are subject to licensing, then CODESYS also starts without any message when a dongle with the required licenses is plugged in to the USB port of the computer or a soft container with the licenses is registered. If the profile includes plug-ins subject to licensing but no dongle or soft container is available or a required license are found, then, CODESYS displays the License Missing dialog at start-up. You can decide whether or not to start CODESYS without the affected plug-ins. Note: When starting from the command line, this dialog is skipped if you specify the --skipunlicensedplugins option in the command. In this case plug-ins without the required license are automatically not loaded. License check in runtime mode While CODESYS is running, the required licenses are checked every five minutes. If a license is missing, for example because the dongle was removed in the meantime, then the License Missing dialog opens. For add-ons which can also be used without a license, the functional scope is adapted depending on the existing or missing license. In case a dongle is disconnected, you have the following options: Insert the dongle again and press Retry : If the dongle contains the missing licenses, then you can continue working as usual. Save Current Project and Exit : CODESYS saves the project and closes. Close : CODESYS closes without saving the project. If you remove the license dongle after the CODESYS plug-in has been loaded, then an error message is displayed. To solve this problem, insert the dongle again and pres the Retry button. If the dongle contains a valid license, the dialog closes and you can continue working as usual. Click Cancel to exit CODESYS . " },

If the declaration editor is used with an implementation language editor , then is opens in a view above the implementation language editor. The declaration editor offers two possible views: textual view and tabular view. In Declaration Editor, you define whether only the textual view or only the tabular view is available, or whether you can switch between both views by means of the buttons on the right side of the editor view. When the editor window gets a scroll bar because of long text lines, you can scroll by rolling the mouse wheel while holding down the Shift key. Zooming in the editor window is possible by rolling the mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key. Declaration editor in online mode In online mode, you see the tabular view of the editor. The header always contains the current object path: <device name>.<application name>.<object name> . In contrast to offline mode, the table also contains the Value and Prepared Value columns. The Value column shows the actual value on the PLC, offering monitoring functionality. If the expression is an array with more than 1,000 elements, then you can define the range of the array indices to monitor. To do this, double-click in the Data Type column to open the Monitoring Area dialog. In this dialog, the declared array range is specified as the Valid area for monitoring. A maximum of 20,000 elements can be monitored per array. You define the range of the array indices to be monitored by specifying the Start and End indices. In order to move this area more easily while maintaining the same size, the available scrollbars can be used coupled. Tot toggle between coupled and not coupled, click the symbol on the right of the bar. In non-coupled state, you can increase or decrease the size of the area to be monitored as desired. The Prepared Value column contains the value that you prepared for forcing or writing . If you double-click a Prepared value field, then you can specify a value explicitly for writing or forcing. In the case of enumerations, a combo box opens from which you can select a value. In the case of a Boolean variable you can toggle the prepared value with the help of the Enter key or the Space bar. If an expression (variable) is of a structured data type, for example the instance of a function block or an array variable, then a plus or a minus sign is placed in front. You can customize the format of the representation of floating-point values in the options for monitoring. " },

You can click and drag anywhere in the editor view to move the visible area of the FBD\/LD\/IL editor or also pivot a CFC chart. Magnification tool A magnified window opens in the lower right corner of the editor view and the mouse pointer changes to the shape of a cross. As you move the mouse pointer over your diagram, the magnification tool shows the area of the diagram below the cross at 100% magnification. Note: If you click in the view, then the magnification tool closes and the part of the diagram that the tool contained is displayed at 100% magnification. If you want to keep the set zoom factor, then you should use to return to the default editing mode. Zooming tool This opens a list box with a selection of zoom factors. Clicking more selections ( ... ) will open the Zoom dialog for typing other values. The current zoom factor is always shown to the left of the symbol. Zooming with the scroll wheel: By holding down the Ctrl key and moving the scroll wheel, you can change the zoom factor in steps of 10%. Every graphical editor has its own Toolbox view that is located on the right of the editor view by default. The toolbox contains elements that you can drag to insertion points in the editor view. CODESYS highlights the insertion points with gray position flags in the shape of diamonds, triangles, or arrows. These flags are green when you move the mouse pointer over them. When you release the mouse button, CODESYS inserts the element at the selected position. It is also possible to use the mouse for moving elements in the editor. You can drag function block declarations in the FBD, LD, and CFC graphical editors to the editor view. To do this, select the full declaration (variable name and data type) and drag it to a suitable position in the editor view. In the ladder diagram, you can also drag Boolean declarations to the editor and insert them as contacts. " },

You can set the cursor at the search location by using the arrow keys or the key combinations Alt + Page Up or Alt + Page Down . When you place the cursor on a symbol name, all occurrence locations of the symbol within the editor are highlighted in color. The search locations correspond to the hits in the cross reference list . For very large projects, this can cause input delays. In this case, you can disable the function in the options of the text editor. CODESYS identifies syntax errors already when inputing in the editor and shows the corresponding messages in the message view ( Precompile category).

The VAR_IN_OUT variable can be read and written. Usage Call : When a POU is called, the formal VAR_IN_OUT variable receives the actual variable (\"pass-by-reference variable\") as the argument. At runtime, no copies are generated when parameters are passed. Instead, the formal variable receives a reference to the actual variable passed remotely. The referential variables contain a memory address internally as a value to the actual value ( pass as pointer , call-by reference ). It is not possible to specify a constant (literal) or a bit variable directly as an argument. Read\/write access within the POU : If the variable is written to within the POU, then this affects the passed variable. When the POU is exited, any performed changes are retained. This means that a POU uses its VAR_IN_OUT variables just like the calling POU uses its variables. Read access is always permitted. Read\/write access remotely : VAR_IN_OUT variables cannot be directly read or written remotely via <function block instance name>.<variable name> . This works only for VAR_INPUT and VAR_OUTPUT variables. Passing string variables : If a string variable is passed as an argument, then the actual variable and the formal variable should have the same length. Otherwise the passed string can be manipulated unintentionally. This problem does not occur in the case of VAR_OUTPUT CONSTANT parameters. Passing bit variables : A bit variable cannot be passed directly to a VAR_IN_OUT variable because it needs an intermediate variable. Passing of properties : Not permitted If a string is passed as a variable or a constant to a formal VAR_IN_OUT CONSTANT variable, then the string is automatically passed completely. You do not have to check the string length.

The operator can be used for implementing a semaphore, for example to guarantee exclusive access to a variable written to by different tasks. __COMPARE_AND_SWAP gets a pointer to a data type __XWORD variable, an old value, and a new value as its input (example: bMutex := __COMPARE_AND_SWAP(ADR(dwSynch), dwOld, dwNew); ). The old and new values can also be data type __XWORD variables. The referenced __XWORD variable is compared with the old value and if both are equal, then the new value is written. The result of the function is TRUE when the new value could be written. The compiler automatically replaces the data type __XWORD with DWORD on 32-bit systems and LWORD on 64-bit systems. This operation is atomic, so it cannot be interrupted by another task, even on multicore platforms. Example The following example shows a typical usage. Exclusive access to a type STRING variable, which is addressed via the pstrOutput pointer, should be implemented. The access to a string is not atomic. If multiple tasks write to the same string at the same time, then the contents may be inconsistent. With this function, it is now possible to write the same STRING variable in different tasks.

"body" : "__XADD The multicore operator is an extension of the IEC 61131-3 standard. The operator can be used for implementing an atomic counter. If an integer variable is incremented by means of ordinary addition, for example iTest := iTest + 1; , then this operation is not executed atomically. Another access to the variable could take place between reading and writing the variable. If the counter is incremented in multiple tasks, then the counter result can be less than the number of counting cycles. So if two tasks execute the above code one time and the variable previously had the value 0 , then the variable can then have the value 1 . This is especially problematic if arrays are being processed in multiple tasks and a unique index is required for the array in each processing cycle. When the __XADD operator is called, it gets a pointer to a type DINT variable as the first summand and a type DINT value as the second summand. __XADD returns the old value of the first summand and in the same step adds the second summand to the first summand. For example, the function call can look like this: diOld := __XADD(ADR(diVar), deAdd); Example The following example shows a typical usage. An array should be populated from two tasks.

"body" : "The rounding logic for borderline cases depends on the target system or the FPU ( Floating Point Unit ) of the target system. For example, a value of -1.5 can be converted differently on different controllers. Catch value ranges overflows across the application to program code-independent from the target system. If the operand value for a type conversion operator is outside of the value range of the target data type, then the result output depends on the processor type and is therefore undefined. This is the case, for example, when a negative operand value is converted from LREAL to the target data type UINT . Information can be lost when converting from larger data types to smaller data types. String manipulation When converting the type to STRING or WSTRING , the typed value is left-aligned as a string and truncated if it is too long. Therefore, declare the return variable for the type conversion operators <>_TO_STRING and <>_TO_WSTRING long enough that the string has enough space without any manipulation. " },

"body" : "Constants are identifiers for unchangeable values. You can declare constants locally within a POU or globally within a global variable list. The declaration segment is extended with the keyword CONSTANT . Constants are also strings that represent the value of a base type, such as integers or floating-point numbers (for example, 16#FFFF_FFFF , T#5s , or -1.234 E-5 ). To distinguish between them, these constants are also called literals, literal constants, or unnamed constants. There are logical ( TRUE , FALSE ) or numeric literals ( 3.1415 , T#5s ), but also string literals ( 'Hello world!' , \"black\" ).

Example VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT\n g_ciMAX_A : INT := 100;\n g_ciSPECIAL : INT := g_ciMAX_A - 10;\nEND_VAR Constants are defined only for the declaration. The assignment of an initial value is required. Within an implementation, constants are only read and therefore always appear on the right of the assignment operator in a statement. The constants are replaced with the initial value when the code is compiled. It also has to be possible to calculate the initial value at compile time. Constants of structured or user-defined types are calculated not until runtime. Structured constants in programs or GVLs are calculated one time at program start. Structured constants in functions or methods are calculated every time the function or method is called. Therefore, the initialization of structured constants can depend on inputs or execute function calls. " },

This means the applicable memory area: input memory area ( I ), output memory area ( Q ), or flag memory area ( M ) (see above). Furthermore, you need to specify the required size prefix: bit, BYTE , WORD , DWORD (see above: X , B , W , D ) The currently used device configuration and device settings (hardware structure, device description, I\/O settings) play a decisive part. Pay special attention to the differences in the interpretation of bit addresses between devices with byte addressing and devices with word-oriented IEC addressing. In the case of the bit address %IX5.5 , the number before the dot addresses byte 5 in a byte-addressed device and word 5 in a word-addressed device. In contrast, addressing with a word or byte address is independent of the device type: with %IW5 , word 5 is always addressed, and with byte address %IB5 always byte 5. Depending on the size and addressing mode, you can therefore address different memory cells with the same address information. The following table shows the comparison of byte addressing and word-oriented IEC addressing for bits, bytes, words, and double words. It also shows the overlapping memory areas for byte addressing. See the example at the end of the table. Concerning syntax, note that the IEC addressing is always word-oriented. The word number is located before the dot, and the bit number after the dot. n = byte number Example of overlapping memory areas for byte addressing D0 contains B0 - B3 . W0 contains B0 and B1 . W1 contains B2 and B3 . W2 contains B4 and B5 . W1 , but also D1 , D2 , and D3 must not be used for addressing. This avoids overlapping. " },

"body" : "STRING searchresult_toplevel In the case of Latin-1 encoding, the memory required for a STRING variable is always 1 byte per character plus one additional byte. For example, this results in 81 bytes in the case of a standard STRING(80) declaration. In the case of UTF-8 encoding, a character can be up to 4 bytes long. However, the length of the string always indicates the number of bytes which are reserved for the STRING. Therefore, there is no longer a 1:1 relationship between the character count and the string length. The STRING data type is interpreted as Latin-1 or UTF-8: If the UTF-8 Encoding for STRING compile option is enabled, then all string literals are interpreted in UTF-8 format. Declaration: <variable name> : STRING( <size> ) := ' <text> '; <variable name> : STRING[ <size> ] := ' <text> '; The memory size <size> and initialization are optional. Example sVar : STRING(46):= 'This is a string with memory for 46 characters.';\nsVar_µ : STRING[10] := 'µ (Mü)';\nsVar_ß : STRING[10] := 'Eszett'; A variable of data type STRING can contain any string. The amount of <size> memory which is reserved during a declaration refers to the number of bytes and is shown in parentheses or brackets. If a size is not defined, then 80 characters are reserved by default. If a variable is initialized with a literal which is too long for the data type, then the literal is truncated accordingly from the right. The length of the strings is however not fundamentally limited. When you execute string manipulations with the functions of the Standard library, strings up to a length of 255 are processed correctly. When you execute string manipulations with the functions of the StringUtils library, you can also use longer strings (>255 characters). When a variable of the data type STRING is reinitialized by resetting the application, the contents of the (old) string, which exist after the terminating null character of the initial value, are not overwritten. This applies both to initialization with the initialization value and to initialization with the default initialization value 0. In compiler version 3.5.18.0 and higher, you can select the encoding format of strings. You have the possibility to specify project-wide whether strings are interpreted in Latin-1 format or UTF-8 format. For UTF-8 encoding, enable the UTF8 Encoding for STRING compile option. For more information, see: Compile options and UTF-8 EncodingBefore you change the encoding format, it is advisable to check your code with static analysis rule SA0175. For more information, see: Static Analysis LightAdd the {attribute 'monitoring_encoding' := 'UTF8'} pragma to the declaration of a variable. Then you can monitor the contents of the variable in UTF8 encoding. For more information, see: Pragma: monitoring_encoding" },

The data sheet of the controller provides information about the processor used on the controller. Currently, vector operations on the x86\/64-bit platforms with SSE2 and ARM64 with NEON are supported natively. On all other platforms, vector operations are translated into individual statements. For example, vector addition is then executed with multiple single addition operations. The command set extensions of the processors are SIMD extensions.

"body" : "global_init_slot The pragma defines the order of initialization of POUs and global variable lists: variables within a GVL or a POU are initialized from top to bottom. If there are several global variable lists, then the initialization order is not defined. The initialization does not apply for the initialization of literal values, for example 1 , 'hello' , 3.6 , or constants of base data types. However, you must define the initialization order yourself if there are dependencies between the lists. You can assign a defined initialization slot to a GVL or POU with the 'global_init_slot' attribute. Constants are initialized before the variables and in the same order as the variables. During initialization, the POUs are sorted according to the value for <slot>. Then the code for initializing the constants is generated and afterwards the code for initializing the variables. Syntax : {attribute 'global_init_slot' := '<slot>'} Insert location The pragma always acts on the entire GVL or POU and therefore it must be located above the VAR_GLOBAL or POU declaration. <slot> Integer value which defines the position in the order of the calls The default value for a POU (program, function block) is 50000. The default value for a GVL is 49990. A lower value means an earlier initialization. If multiple POUs have been assigned the same value for the 'global_init_slot' attribute, then the order of their initialization remains undefined. Example The project includes two global variable lists GVL_1 and GVL_2 , as well as the PLC_PRG program which uses the variables from both lists. GVL_1 uses the variable B for initializing the variable A , which is initialized in GVL_2 with 1000 . GVL_1 VAR_GLOBAL \/\/49990\n A : INT := GVL_2.B*100;\nEND_VAR GVL_2 VAR_GLOBAL \/\/49990\n B : INT := 1000;\n C : INT := 10;\nEND_VAR PLC_PRG PROGRAM PLC_PRG \/\/50000\nVAR\n ivar: INT := GVL_1.A;\n ivar2: INT;\nEND_VAR\n\nivar:=ivar+1;\nivar2:=GVL_2.C; In this case, the compiler prints an error because GVL_2.B is used for initializing GVL_1.A before GVL_2 has been initialized. You can prevent this by using the global_init_slot attribute to position GVL_2 before GVL_1 in the initialization sequence. In this example, GVL_1 must have at least one slot value of 49989 in order to achieve the earliest initialization within the program. Every lower value has the same effect: GVL_2 {attribute 'global_init_slot' := '100'}\nVAR_GLOBAL\n B : INT := 1000;\nEND_VAR Using GVL_2.C in the implementation part of PLC_PRG is also not critical even without using a pragma because both GVLs are initialized before the program in either case.

"body" : "When you insert the pragma {attribute 'monitoring':='call'} for monitoring, you have to pay attention to possible side effects. These kinds of side effects can occur if additional operations are implemented in the property. The pragma {attribute 'monitoring'} is also evaluated for the symbol configuration. Only read access is possible for the value 'variable' . In the online view of a function block or program, you can monitor the subordinate properties in addition to the local variables. This allows you to monitor the values of the Get and Set methods. Insert either the pragma {attribute 'monitoring' := 'variable'} or {attribute 'monitoring' := 'call'} in the declaration of the property block. The current values of the property are then displayed automatically in the IEC editor or in a watch list. Example In online mode, the PLC_PRG object shows the value of the Minutes property at the call location inline in the ST editor. This is because the pragma {attribute 'monitoring' := 'variable'} is located in the declaration of the Minutes property. Check carefully for each application which attribute pragma is suitable for displaying the desired value. This depends on whether further operations with the variables are implemented within the property. Pragma: {attribute 'monitoring':='variable'} : An implicit variable is created for the property, which is then always given the current property value when the application calls the Set or Get method. The value stored last in this variable is displayed in the monitoring. Pragma: {attribute 'monitoring':='call'} You can use this attribute only for properties that return simple data types or pointers, but not for structured types. The value to be monitored is read or written by calling the property directly. This means that the monitoring service of the runtime executes the Get or Set method of the property. With the context menu command Add Watch , a variable on which the cursor is currently positioned is applied directly into the monitoring list in online mode. The forcing or writing of functions is not supported. However, you can implicitly implement forcing by adding an additional input parameter for the respective function, which serves as an internal force flag. Function monitoring is not possible in the compact runtime. " },

Strings always at byte addresses. No gaps result. Depending on the structure, there may be no difference in the memory mapping of the individual modes. For example, the memory distribution of a structure with the {attribute 'pack mode' := '4'} pragma can correspond to that of {attribute 'pack mode' := '8'} . Arrays of structures If the structures are combined in arrays, then bytes are added at the end of the structure so that the next structure is aligned. If the Compatibility layout option is selected in the symbol configuration and at the same time the attribute 'pack_mode' is used in the code, then problems can occur due to unintentional memory misalignment. Negative effects when using 'pack-mode' Unaligned memory access can be the result of using the attribute 'pack_mode' . This means, for example, that a data type with a size of 4 bytes is then located at an address which is not divisible by 4. Normally, on a 32-bit system a 32-bit data type can be read and written with a single memory access. On some platforms, for example on ARM platforms, this is possible only when this value is aligned in the memory. On other platforms, it can be that the access is possible but it is performed much more slowly. {attribute 'pack_mode':=1}\n\nTYPE DUT\nSTRUCT\n by1 : BYTE;\n dw1 : DWORD;\nEND_STRUCT\nEND_TYPE On an ARM platform, the value dw1 cannot be read with a single access. When an attempt is made to access this element directly, the ARM processor will throw an exception. Assumption: The following read access is performed: dwTest := dut1.dw1; For this access to the DWORD dw1 , four memory accesses are required because each byte is read, shifted, and disjuncted individually. The flow is somewhat the same as in the following example in which a DWORD is generated from an array of four bytes: dwHelp := bytes[0];\ndwResult := dwHelp;\ndwHelp := bytes[1];\ndwHelp := SHL(dwHelp, 8);\ndwResult := dwResult OR dwHelp;\ndwHelp := bytes[2];\ndwHelp := SHL(dwHelp, 16);\ndwResult := dwResult OR dwHelp;\ndwHelp := bytes[3];\ndwHelp := SHL(dwHelp, 24);\ndwResult := dwResult OR dwHelp; Obviously, this kind of access is much slower than access to a DWORD , which is aligned appropriately in the memory. pdw := ADR(dut1.dw1);\ndwTest := pdw^; However, the compiler will not generate the access of the example when this kind of member is accessed by means of a pointer. This means that the following code results in an exception on an ARM platform. pdw := ADR(dut1.dw1);\ndwTest := pdw^; For performance reasons, you should therefore avoid working with structures which are not naturally aligned. A packed structure must not contain an unpacked structure. " },

The {IF<expression> } pragmas together with {ELSIF<expression> } , {ELSE} , and the concluding {END_IF} indicate code in implementations which is retained or ignored depending on the specified conditions. The conditions specified in <expression> are integer constant expressions which can be composed of different operands and operators.

"body" : "An identifier must not be declared two times locally. An identifier can be used more than one time globally. If a local variable has the same name as a global variable, then the local variable has priority within the POU. An identifier is not permitted to be identical to a keyword. Example: Scope of VAR_Global A variable that is declared in a global variable list can have the same name as a variable defined in another GVL. CODESYS provides features that extend the standard for the namespace or scope of variables: Global namespace operator An instance path that begins with a dot always opens a global namespace. If there is a local variable (for example, ivar ) that has the same name as a global variable, then you refer to the global variable as .ivar . The name of a global variable list can define the namespace uniquely for the include variables. Therefore, you can declare variables with the same name in different global variables list and still uniquely reference by prepending the list name. Example: globlist1.ivar := globlist2.ivar; (* ivar from GVL globlist2 is copied to ivar in GVL globlist1 *) Variables that are defined in the global variable list of a library included in the project can be addressed uniquely according to the following syntax: <name scope library>.< GVL name>.<variable name> Example: globlist1.ivar := lib1.globlist1.ivar (* ivar from GVL globlist1 in library lib1 is copied to ivar in GVL globlist1 *) When inserting a library, you also use the Library Manager to define a namespace. In this way, you can make unique references to a library POU or library variable by <namespace library >.<POU name\\|variable name> . Note that when libraries are nested, you need to reference the namespaces of all libraries are in succession. Example: If Lib1 is referenced by Lib0 , then the POU func in Lib1 is addressed by Lib0.Lib1.fun : ivar := Lib0.Lib1.fun(4, 5); (* return value from func is copied to variable ivar in the project *) " },

During the online change, the changes to the application that were made in offline mode are applied in the running PLC. Therefore, the \"old\" function block instances are replaced by your \"new siblings\" as much as possible without incident. If no changes were made to the declaration part of a function block in the application before login, but in the implementation only, then the data areas are not replaced. Only code blocks are replaced. Then the methods FB_Exit , FB_Init , and FB_Reinit are not called. If you have made changes to the declaration of a function block that lead to the copying operation described above, then you receive a message during the online change about \"possible unintended effects\". In the Details of the message view, you see a list of all instances to be copied. In the code of the FB_Init method, the parameter bInCopyCode ( TRUE ) can be evaluated to detect whether or not an online change is being executed. The following calls occur in succession during an online change: FB_Exit old_inst.FB_Exit(bInCopyCode := TRUE); You can call FB_Exit when exiting the \"old\" instance in order to trigger specific cleanup tasks before the copy operation . In this way, you can prepare the data for the following copy operation and influence the state of the new instance. You can notify other parts of the application about the pending change in location in the memory. Pay special attention to the variables of type POINTER and REFERENCE . These may no longer refer to the required memory locations after the online change. Interface variables ( INTERFACE ) are handled separately by the compiler and they are adapted accordingly during the online change. External resources such as sockets, files, or other handles can be applied by the new instance, in some case unchanged. Often they do not have to be treated specially during an online change. (See \"'Re-download' operating case\") FB_Init new_inst.FB_Init(bInitRetains := FALSE, bInCopyCode := TRUE); FB_Init is called before the copy operation and can be used in order to execute specific operations for the online change. For example, you can initialize variables accordingly at the \"new\" location in the memory, or notify other parts of the application about the new location of specific variables in the memory. Copy operation: copy copy(&old_inst, &new_inst); Existing values remain unchanged. For this purpose, they are copied from the old instance into the new instance. FB_Reinit new_inst.FB_Reinit(); This method is called after the copy operation and should set defined values for the variables of the instance. For example, you can initialize variables accordingly at the \"new\" location in the memory, or notify other parts of the application about the new location of specific variables in the memory. Design the implementation independent of the online change. The method can also be called from the application at any time in order to reset a function block instance to its original state. With the {attribute 'no_copy'} attribute, you can prevent that this is copied during the online change for a single variable of the function block. It always retains the initial value.

In order to control the effects of these assignments, you can provide a function block or a method of a function block with the {attribute ‘call_after_init‘} attribute. You have to add the attribute above the declaration part of the function block body and above the declaration part of the corresponding method. A POU that extends another POU which uses the {attribute 'call_after_init'} attribute must also have the attribute. For the benefit of clarity, we recommend that the corresponding methods are overwritten with the same name, the same signature, and the same attribute. This requires calling SUPER^.MyInit . The name of the method can be chosen without restriction. (Exceptions: FB_Init , FB_Reinit , and FB_Exit ). The method is called after processing the initial assignments and before starting the application tasks. Therefore, the method can react to user input. When using FB_Init or {attribute 'call_after_init'} , remember that detecting errors in the FB_Init method or in methods decorated with the {attribute 'call_after_init'} attribute is tedious, because the setting of breakpoints may not have the expected effect. If the explicitly defined initialization code is reached during execution, then the function block instance is already completely initialized via the implicit initialization code. Therefore, there must not be a SUPER^.FB_Init call. FB_Init replaces the INI operator which is used in CoDeSys V2.3 .

When such variables change, large gaps can occur in the persistent data, leading to this error. Error correction : The following action can fix the error. Run the Reorder List and Clear Gaps command to reorder the persistent variables and reallocate the memory. The persistent variables should then be reinitialized.

"body" : "Application Symbol: The object is displayed as a node in the device tree . It comprises the objects which are required for a controller program to run. You can insert an application object below a  PLC Logic node (below a programmable device). Below each application, there has to be a Task Configuration where you configure which program of the application will be called by which task and using which settings. Furthermore, you insert the POUs of your controller program below an application, for example POUs, global variables lists, and the Library Manager. These POUs are available only for this application. In  CODESYS version 3.5 SP20 and higher, adding child application actions with the Add Object command is no longer supported. The application can also use instances of project-global POUs. You manage project-global POUs in the POUs view. The use of these kinds of instances is based on the idea of object-oriented programming. Multiple applications can be inserted below a PLC device object. To do this, they have to have unique names. An online change after a changing the \"parent application\" will remove the \"child application\" from the PLC. When multiple applications are directly below a CODESYS device, for the I\/O handling of the device you need to define the application whose variables should be used for communication with the target system. The settings are configured on the PLC Settings tab of the device editor. The application that you want to work with in online mode has to be set as the \"active application\" (see App2 in the figure above). You can set special properties for an application on the Application Build Options tab of the Properties dialog of the application object. Example: Activation of dynamic memory allocation When downloading the application to the PLC, you can include information about the application contents. This is also a setting on the Application Build Options tab. Then later you can compare the application on the controller with the active application in CODESYS . If you want to add individual information about the author, version, and an individual short description, you can modify the information in the general Project Information on the Information tab of the Properties dialog. When you want to log in to the target system (PLC or simulation) with an application, it will first be checked which applications are currently on the PLC and whether or not the application parameters on the controller match those in the project configuration. Corresponding messages will notify you about mismatches and possible options for additional action. In this step, you can also delete applications from the PLC. For more information, see: Downloading an Application to the PLCOn the Application tab of the device editor, you can see which applications currently exist on the device. There you can also delete applications from the target system. It is possible that you also see additional applications which are not represented by a separate object in the device tree, for example the <application>_symbols.app , which contains a symbol list created for the application (see “Symbol Configuration”).

Example: S_POLYGONLINE Advanced : Extends an existing structure by more members In the input field, specify an existing structure. The members of the existing structure are automatically available in the new structure. Example: S_PENTAGON Enumeration Creates an object which declares an enumeration that combines multiple integer constants into a logical unit The constants declared within an enumeration are also called enumeration values. Example: E_TRAFFICSIGNAL An enumeration can also have a text list. This is used to localize the values of the enumeration. As a result, the object also has a localization view. Add Text List Support : Enumeration which does not have any text list support : Enumeration with additionally stored text list for the enumeration values The text list allows you to localize the names of the enumeration values. Example: ETL_TRAFFICSIGNAL Note: In the case of an existing enumeration type, text list support can be added or removed at any time. The commands in the context menu of the object are used for this: Add Text List Support Remove text list support Hint: The localized texts can be displayed, for example, in a visualization. In this case, the text output of a visualization element displays the symbolic enumeration values in the current language instead of the numeric enumeration values. When an enumeration with text list support is specified in the Text variable property of a visualization element, it gets the following additional property: < <enumeration name> > . Example: In a visualization, you use the variable PLC_PRG.eTrafficLight of type ETL_TRAFFICSIGNAL . ETL_TRAFFICSIGNAL is an enumeration with text list support. Then the entry in the properties editor of the visualization element looks like this: PLC_PRG.eTrafficLight <ETL_TRAFFICSIGNAL> . For more information, see also: Using Texts Hint: When you edit the enumeration type in the application, a prompt opens when you close the application and asks whether the affected visualizations should be updated automatically. Alias Creates an object which declares an alias with which an alternative name is declared for a base type, data type, or function block Example: A_MESSAGE Union Creates an object which declares a union that combines multiple members with mostly different data types into a logical unit All members have the same offset so that they are occupy the same memory. The memory requirement of a union is determined by the memory requirement of its \"largest\" member.

"body" : "On this tab of the generic device editor, you define the connection between CODESYS and the device on which your application(s) should run. This includes security settings such as encrypted communication and signing. If you prefer the classic mode of display for the dialog, then select it in the CODESYS Options in the Device editor category. You select a gateway and a target device from the list boxes. The possible selections depend on the entries in the Manage Gateways and Manage Favorite Devices dialogs (see the Gateway menu). You can also specify the target directly with the IP address (example: \"192.168.101.109\"), the device address (example: [056D] ), or the device name (example: MyDevice ). After the device is entered, CODESYS searches for the device in the network of the gateway. The option of searching by device name requires unique device names in the network. The solid circle on the lower right corner of the gateway symbol provides information about the connection status: Red: CODESYS cannot establish the connection. Green: The connection is established. Black: The connection status is unknown. Some communication protocols allow regular checking of the gateway so that the status cannot be displayed. Clicking the solid circle of the target device starts a network scan for the device. This works only if the network is not already being scanned. Scan Network This button opens the Select Device dialog. It lists all configured gateways with the associated devices. You can select one target device from this list. If the name of the selected device is unique, then the name will be used in the connection settings. Otherwise, the unique device address is applied. The displayed parameters are defined in the SysTarget component in the runtime system and essentially represent the type plate of the controller. The device name can be changed using the Device → Rename Active Device command. Option: Hide non-matching devices, filter by Target ID : : The display is limited on the devices that have the same target ID as the current device configured in the project. : All available devices in the network are displayed. Double-clicking the entry of a device, which has a different target system ID than the device configured in the project, opens a dialog box. This dialog box allows you to update the device description of the device in the project to the one matching the selected device. Note: This kind of update is possible only with devices which have different IDs, not for those which only have different versions. The update also requires that the device description is already installed in the repository. Gateway This menu includes the following commands: Add New Gateway : Opens the Gateway dialog for defining a new gateway channel Manage Gateways : Opens the Manage Gateways dialog with an overview of all gateways. Here you can add, delete, or edit entries or change their order. Configure Local Gateway : Opens the Gateway Configuration dialog. You can configure the block drivers for the local gateway. Device This menu includes the following commands: Options: Add Current Device to Favorites : Adds the currently set device to the list of favorite devices Manage Favorite Devices : Opens the favorites dialog with a list of all preferred devices. In this dialog, you can add or delete entries or change their order. The top device is the default. Confirmed Online Mode : : For security reasons, CODESYS requires a confirmation from you when calling the following online commands: Force Values , Write Values , Multiple Loading , Release Force List , Single Cycle , Start , Stop . Store Communication Settings in Project : : CODESYS saves the communication settings in the project for reuse on the same computer. Note: If you use the project on another computer, then you need to reset the active path. : CODESYS saves the communication settings in the options of the local installation for reuse on the same computer. Note: When using CODESYS SVN, the option should be cleared in order to prevent a lock on the device object. Rename Active Device : Opens a dialog for changing the device name Wink Active Device : Devices that support this function react by blinking. Send Echo Service : CODESYS sends five echo services to the controller. These are used to test the network connection, similar to the \"ping\" function. The services are sent first without a payload and then with a payload. The scope of the payload depends on the communication buffer of the PLC. A message view opens with information about the average echo service delay and the scope of the sent payload. Encrypted Communication : : The communication to this controller is encrypted. A certificate of the controller is required in order to log in to the controller. If the certificate is not available, then an error message opens prompting whether or not the certificate should be displayed and installed. If the Enforce encrypted communication option is selected as the Security level in the Security Screen view, then the Encrypted Communication command is disabled here. Change Runtime Security Policy Opens the Change Runtime Security Policy dialog for changing the device setting for the encryption of communication Change Runtime Password Policy Opens the Change Runtime Password Policy dialog to change the settings for the password policy and the login lock Security Settings : This command is available only if CODESYS Security Agent >= 1.3.0.0 is installed. It opens the Device Security Settings dialog. The current security settings on the connected device are displayed. You can change the settings in the Value column and click OK to write them to the device. For example, you will find the settings for device user management and password policy under the CmpUserMgr node (see also further below). Dialog: Change Runtime Security Policy When you select a new communication policy in this dialog, the configuration in the runtime system is changed. Communication Settings Current policy Shows the currently selected policy for the encryption of communication with the device New policy List box for the new policy for encryption No encryption : The device does not support encrypted communication. Optional encryption : The device supports encrypted and unencrypted communication. Enforced encryption : The device supports encrypted communication only. Code Signing Current policy Display of the code signing policy which is currently set in the runtime system New policy All : All types of application code are accepted. Enforced signing : Only signed application code is accepted (preventing loading an application from untrusted sources). Device User Management Current policy Shows the currently selected policy for user management New policy Optional user management : It is the responsibility of the user to enable user management on the device or leave the device unprotected. Enforced user management : The user management on the device is enabled and cannot be disabled by the user. Corresponding entry in the Security Settings : CmpUserMgr UserMgmtEnforce . Allow anonymous login : Specific registered components (for example, OPC UA) can connect to the controller without the providing any credentials. Even if anonymous access to the OPC UA is permitted, the created device user management for the controller remains active. Corresponding entry in the Security Settings of the device: CmpUserMgr UserMgmt.AllowAnonymous . Dialog: Change Runtime Password Policy The runtime system password policy configured here is checked in advance in the programming system when the password for a new device user is entered or when the existing password of a device user is changed. If a limited validity period for a password is configured in the password policy, then the user is prompted to set a new password when logging in after this period has elapsed. Note: To change a password before it expires, a user currently still requires read permission for the device user management. Password policy is active Password policy is active : The policy is enabled by default. The Password settings can be changed and are used when a password for the device user management is created. The corresponding entries in the Security Settings of the device are located under the CmpUserMgr node ( UserMgmt.PasswordPolicy.<..> ). In the configuration file of CODESYS Control , this corresponds to the CmpUserMgr section. Example: [CmpUserMgr]\nSECURITY.UserMgmt.PasswordPolicy=ENABLED Password settings Minimum length Default setting: 8 Number of unique characters Default setting: 4 Requires lowercase letter Default setting: enabled Requires uppercase letter Default setting: enabled Requires digit Default setting: enabled Requires special character Default setting: enabled Must not contain username Default setting: enabled The following rules for the password always apply, even when the rules are partially or completely disabled: The password must not be blank. The password must not contain the user name. Password expiration is active : The Password expiration settings can be modified and are applied at login. Corresponding entries in the Security Settings of the device: Under the CmpUserMgr node ( Password.Expiration.<...> ). Password expiration settings : Scope : ADMINS : The settings apply to users who have administrator permissions. NONADMINS : The settings apply to all users who do not have administrator permissions. ALL : The settings apply to all users. Timeout [days] : Validity period of the password in days. When this time is exceeded, it is no longer possible to log in with the previous password. In this case, you will immediately be prompted to set a new password. Login lock is active : The Login lock settings are applied at login. Corresponding entries in the Security Settings of the device: Under the CmpUserMgr node ( UserLogin.<...> ). Login lock settings Scope ADMINS : The settings apply to users who have administrator permissions. NONADMINS : The settings apply to all users who do not have administrator permissions. ALL : The settings apply to all users. Maximal Retries : When the number of login attempts specified here is exceeded, the user will be locked out for the amount of time which is specified in the Lock duration field.

Application for I\/O handling Application that is responsible for the I\/O handling PLC Settings Refresh I\/Os in stop : The values of the input and output channels are also refreshed when the PLC is in STOP mode. If the watchdog detects a malfunction, the outputs are set to the predefined default values. : The values of the input and output channels in STOP mode are not refreshed. Behavior of the outputs at stop Handling of the output channels when the controller enters STOP mode: Retain values : The current values are retained. All outputs to default value : The default values resulting from the I\/O mapping are assigned. Execute program : The handling of the output values is controlled by a program contained in the project which is executed in STOP mode. Enter the name of the program in the field on the right. Always update variables Globally defines whether or not the I\/O variables are updated in the bus cycle task This setting is effective for the I\/O variables of the slaves and modules only if \" deactivated \" is defined in their update settings. Deactivated (update only if used in a task) : The I\/O variables are updated only if they are used in a task. Enabled 1 (use bus cycle task if not used in any task) : The I\/O variables in the bus cycle task are updated if they are not used in any other task. Enabled 2 (always in bus cycle task) : All variables in each cycle of the bus cycle task are updated, regardless of whether they are used and whether they are mapped to an input or output channel. The availability of this option depends on the device description. Bus cycle options Bus cycle task Task that controls the bus cycle. By default the task defined by the device description is entered. By default, the bus cycle setting of the superordinate bus device applies (use cycle settings of the superordinate bus). This means that the device tree is searched upwards for the next valid definition of the bus cycle task. Before you select the \" <unspecified> \" setting for the bus cycle task, you should be aware that \" <unspecified> \" means that the default setting given in the device description goes into effects. You should therefore check this description. Use of the task with the shortest cycle time may be defined as the default there, but use of the task with the longest cycle time could equally well be defined! For fieldbuses, a fixed cycle matrix is necessary to assure a determined behavior. Therefore, do not use the \" freewheeling \" type for a bus cycle task. Additional Settings Force variables for the I\/O mapping This setting is available only if it is supported by the device. : When compiling the application, two global variables are created for each I\/O channel which is mapped to a variable in the I\/O Mapping dialog. You can use these variables for the forcing of the input or output value on this channel, for example via an HMI visualization. Activate diagnostics for devices : The CAA Device Diagnosis library is integrated in the project. An implicit function block is generated for each device. If there is already a function block for the device, then either an extended function block is generated (example: EtherCAT) or another function block instance is added. This then contains a general implementation of the device diagnostics. By means of the function block instances you can determine the status of all devices in the application and evaluate errors. In addition, the library contains functions for the programmatic editing of the device tree. Example: Scanning of all children of a bus system, jumping to the parent element. For more information, see: CAA Device Diagnosis Library Documentation Display I\/O warnings as errors Warnings concerning the I\/O configuration are displayed as errors. Enable symbolic access for I\/Os : Input and output variables (VAR_INPUT and VAR_OUTPUT ) are automatically created for the I\/O channels of the device. For this purpose, an extended function block is created for each slave. The basis is the existing function block of the slave. This kind of automatically generated function block can be accessed directly in the application code. This symbolic access works in parallel to the I\/O mapping which was set up manually. : Access to I\/O channels is not supported. It is necessary to manually set up a mapping and specifically assign new or existing variables per I\/O channel. " },

"body" : "This tab is displayed in device editors for devices with I\/O channels. It shows the available channels and allows for the mapping of input, output, and memory addresses of the controller to variables or entire function blocks of the application. You create the 'I\/O Mapping' in this way. For more information, see: Configuring Devices and I\/O MappingThe application that is to take care of the I\/O handling is defined on the PLC Settings tab. You can use the \"Online Configuration Mode\" if the device supports it. In this mode, you can access the I\/Os of the hardware without having to download an actual application to the device beforehand. If an I\/O channel is not referenced in the application, then its value will not be updated. If you want to monitor non-referenced I\/O channels, then you need to enable the Always update variables option on the Tab: PLC Settings. Alternatively, you could also enable this option on the I\/O Mapping tab of a device. Then enabling is valid only for this one device and its children. Mapping data types which are \"too large\" If a variable of a data type that is larger than a byte is mapped to a byte address, the value of the variable will be truncated to byte size there. For monitoring the variable value in the I\/O Mapping dialog, this means that, in the root element of the address, the value is displayed which the variable currently has in the project. The current individual bit values of the byte are displayed in succession in the bit elements below that, but this may not be sufficient for the entire variable value. Example of the <device name> I\/O Mapping tab for a CAN bus slave: The tab contains a table for editing the I\/O mapping. The information displayed for the inputs and outputs originates from the device description. Find (1) Input field for a string to search for in the mapping table The search results are highlighted in yellow. Filter (2) List box with filters for the I\/O mappings displayed in the mapping table: Show all Show only outputs Show only inputs Show only unmapped variables Show only mapped variables Show only mapping to existing variables Show only mapping to new variables Add FB for IO channel (11) Depending on the device, available if the channel entry is selected in the mapping table Opens the Select Function Block dialog for selecting the function block that should be linked directly to the channel Go to instance (12) Available if the entry is selected in the mapping table Jumps to the corresponding entry on the <device name> IEC Objects tab Variable Depending on the device, the inputs and outputs of the device are displayed as nodes and below them, indented, the associated channels or, depending on the device, only the implicitly created device instance. The symbol indicates the type of channel: : Input : Output Double-click the cell to open an input field. Possibility 1: The variable already exists. Specify the full path: <application name>.<POU name>.<variable name> Example: app1.plc_prg.ivar ; Input Assistant via Possibility 2: The variable does not exist yet. Specify simple names Automatically created internally as a global variable Depending on the device, inputs or outputs can be linked directly to a function block. In this case, the Add FB for IO channel button can be clicked. See above. Mapping (3) Type of mapping: : Existing variable : New variable : Mapping to function block instance Channel (4) Symbolic name of the channel. Address (5) Address of the channel (example: %IW0 ) Address strikethrough: Indicates that you should not assign any more variables to this address. Reason: Although the variable specified here is managed – as an existing variable –at a different memory location, ambiguity could result when the values are written, particularly with outputs. : Indicates that this address has been edited and fixed If the arrangement of the device objects in the device tree changes, then CODESYS does not adapt this address automatically. Type (6) Data type of the channel (example: BOOL ) Structures or bit fields defined in the device description are displayed only if they are part of the IEC standard and are identified as IEC data types in the device description. Otherwise the table cell remains empty. When mapping structured variables, the editor prevents you from specifying both the structure variable (example: %QB0 ) and individual structure elements (example: %QB0.1 and QB0.2 ). Therefore, if there is a main entry with a subtree of bit channel entries in the mapping table, then the following applies: You can input a variable either into the line of the main entry, or into the lines of the subelements (bit channels), but not into both. Default Value Default value of the parameter that applies to the channel: Appears only if the option Set all outputs to default is selected in the PLC Settings for the behavior of the outputs at stop. Note: For compiler version V3.5 SP11 and higher, the initialization value of the variables is used automatically as the default value when mapping to an existing variable. You can edit the Default value field only if you map to a new created variable. In older versions, users had to specify explicitly that the default value and initialization value were identical. Unit (7) Unit for the parameter value (example: ms for milliseconds) Description (8) Short description of the parameter Current value Actual value of the parameter applied to the channel; displayed in online mode only The change of the default value by an online change is allowed, however the value is applied only after a \"Reset cold\" or \"Reset warm\". Reset Mapping (9) CODESYS resets the mapping settings to the default values as defined in the device description file. Always update variables (10) Definition for the device object about updating I\/O variables The default value is defined in the device description: Use parent device setting : Update according to the setting of the superordinate device. Enabled 1 (use bus cycle task if not used in any task) : CODESYS updates the I\/O variables in the bus cycle task if they are not used in any other task. Enabled 2 (always in bus cycle task) : CODESYS updates all variables in each cycle of the bus cycle task, regardless of whether they are used and whether they are mapped to an input or output channel. If a UNION is represented by I\/O channels in the mapping dialog, it depends on the device whether mapping to the root element is also possible.

"body" : "Generally, for each IEC task, the used input data is read at the start of each task (1) and the written output data is transferred to the I\/O driver at the end of the task (3). The implementation in the I\/O driver is decisive for additional transfer of the I\/O data. It is responsible for the time frame and time point that the actual transfer to the corresponding bus system occurs. The bus cycle task of the PLC can be defined globally for all fieldbuses in the PLC settings. For some fieldbuses, however, you can change this independent of the global setting. The task with the shortest cycle time is used as the bus cycle task (setting: unspecified in the PLC settings). The messages are normally sent on the bus in this task. Other tasks copy only the I\/O data from an internal buffer that is exchanged only with the physical hardware in the bus cycle task.

If an output is written in various tasks, then the status is undefined, as this can be overwritten in each case. If the same inputs are used in various tasks, then it is possible for the input to change during the processing of a task. This happens when the task is interrupted by a task with a higher priority and causes the process image to be read again. Solution: At the beginning of the IEC task, copy the input variables to variables and then work only with the local variables in the rest of the code. Conclusion: Using the same inputs and outputs in several tasks does not make any sense and can lead to unexpected reactions in some cases. " },

Use additional data link layers for protection, such as VPN for remote access, and install firewall mechanisms. Restrict access to authorized persons only, change any existing default passwords during the initial commissioning, and change them in regular intervals. Detailed information on the concept and use of device user management is provided in the Handling of Device User Management chapter. There you will also find the following instructions on how to use the editor: First-time login to the controller for editing and viewing its user management Setting up a new user in the user management of the controller Changing of access rights to controller objects in the user management of the controller Loading user management from a *.dum file, modifying it, and downloading it to the controller in offline mode On this tab, you define the device access rights of device users to objects on the controller. As in the project user management, users must be members of at least one user group and only user groups can be granted certain access rights. Requirements for the Access Rights tab to be displayed: The Show access rights page option has to be selected in the CODESYS options in Device editor category. Note that this CODESYS option can be overwritten by the device description. Requirements for the access rights to be granted to user groups A component for the user management has to be available on the controller. That is the primary requirement. Users and user groups have to be configured on the Users and Groups tab. Objects In the tree structure, the objects are listed to which actions can be executed at runtime. The objects are each assigned by their object source and partially sorted in object groups. In the Rights view, you can configure the access options for a user group to a selected object. Object source (root node) File system objects → Device : In these objects, the permissions can be granted to folders of the current execution directory of the controller. Runtime objects → \/ : In these objects, all objects are managed which have online access in the controller and therefore have to control the permissions. A description of the objects is located in the Overview of the objects table. Object groups and objects (indented) Example: Device with child nodes Logger , PlcLogic , Settings , UserManagement . Permissions In general, the subobjects inherit the permissions from the root object ( Device or \/ ). This means that if a permission of a user group is denied or explicitly granted to a parent object, then this first affects all child objects. The table applies for the object that is currently selected in the tree. For every user group, it shows the rights currently configured for the possible actions on this object. Possible actions on the object: Add\/Remove Modify View Execute When an object is clicked, a table on the right side shows the access rights of the available user groups for the selected object. This allows you to quickly see: Which access rights are evaluated by an object Which user group has which effective rights to which object Meanings of the symbols : Access right granted explicitly : Access right denied explicitly : Access right granted through inheritance : Access right denied through inheritance : The access right was not granted or denied explicitly and also not inherited by the parent object. Access is not possible. No symbol: Multiple objects are selected that have different access rights. Change the permission by clicking the symbol. Example The Logger object on the Access Rights tab was created by the \"Logger\" component and controls its access rights. It is located directly below the Device runtime object. The possible access rights for this object can be granted only for the View action. Initially, each object has a read access. This means that every user can read the \"Logger\" of a controller. If this access right should be denied for a single user group ( Service in the example), then the read access to the logger object has to be denied explicitly. " },

PlcLogic All IEC applications are inserted here automatically as child objects during download. When an application is deleted, it is removed automatically. This allows specific control of online access to the application. Access rights can be assigned centrally over all applications in the PlcLogic The Administrator and Developer user groups have full access to the IEC applications. The Service and Watch user groups only have read access (for example for read-only monitoring of values).

This means that only when the Modify permission has been granted to a user group can PLC shell commands also be evaluated. RemoteConnections Additional external connections to the controller can be configured below this node. Currently, access to the OPCUA server can be configured here. Settings This is the online access to the configuration settings of a controller. Security Settings : By default, access to Modify of the security settings is granted only to the administrator. UserManagement This is the online access to the user management of a controller. By default, read\/write access is granted only to the administrator. Access Rights : When this object is selected, permissions can be configured on the permissions management in the Rights view. That means you can configure which user group is allowed to simply read the permissions management, and which user group is allowed to change the permissions management as well. Groups : A separate object is automatically created for each user group of the device user management and displayed below Groups . When a user group object is selected, the permissions on the user group can be configured. That means you can configure which user group is allowed to read or modify the user group (for example, add new users to the user group). By default, objects are available for the following user groups: Administrator Developer Service Watch This allows graduated or restricted administrator groups to be set up. For example, a visualization administrator group can be set up which can only add existing users to the visualization user group, but cannot create new users or change the passwords of existing users. Users : When this object is selected, the permissions of the user group on the users can be configured. That means you can configure which user group is allowed to read, modify, or add users (for example, add new users). For more information, see: Handling of Device User ManagementX509 This controls the online access to the X.509 certificates. Two types of access are distinguished here: Read ( View ) Write ( Modify ) Every operation is assigned to one of these two access rights. Each operation is inserted as a child object below X509. Therefore, access per operation can now be fine-tuned even more. File system objects → \/ All folders from the execution path of the controller are inserted below the \" \/ \" file system object.

In this case, you have to move the library from the Library Manager of the application to the Library Manager of the project (in the POUs view). After that, you can call the POU object in the POUs view simply by its name. When you add the namespace to the library, you can call the POU of the library. The term \"POU\" is also used in CODESYS for the POUs view where CODESYS manages the objects which are valid throughout the project. " },

Access to a function block instance is restricted to the POU in which the instance is declared, unless you have declared the instance globally. You can assign the desired values to the function block variables when you call the instance. Example Access to function block variables: The function block FB1 has the input variable iVar1 of type INT and the output variable out1 . In the following, the variable iVar1 is called from the program Prog . PROGRAM Prog\nVAR\ninst1 : FB1;\nEND_VAR\n\ninst1.iVar1 := 33; (* FB1 is called and the value 33 is assigned to the variable iVar1 *)\n\ninst1(); (* FB1 is called, that's necessary for the following access to the output variable *)\n\nires := inst1.out1 (* the output variable out1 of the FB1 is read *) In FBD: Assigning variable values when calling: In the textual languages IL and ST, you can assign values directly to input and\/or output variables when you call the function block. A value is assigned to an input variable with := . A value is assigned to an output variable with => . Example The instance CMD_TMR of the timer function block is called with assignments for the input variables IN and PT . Then the output variable Q of the timer is assigned to the variable A . PROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n CMD_TMR : TOF;\nEND_VAR\n\nCMD_TMR(IN := %IX5.1, PT := T#100MS);\nA := CMD_TMR.Q; When you insert a function block instance by means of the Input Assistant and select the Insert with arguments option in the Input Assistant dialog, CODESYS inserts the call with all input and output variables. Then you only have to insert the desired value assignment. In the example above, CODESYS inserts the call as follows: CMD_TMR (IN:= ,PT:= , Q=> ) .

"body" : "Interface Symbol: Keyword: INTERFACE An interface is a means of object-oriented programming. The object ITF describes a set of method and property prototypes. In this context, prototype means that the methods and properties contain only declarations and no implementation. This allows different function blocks having common properties to be used in the same way. An ITF object is added to the application or the project by clicking Project → Add Object → Interface For more information, see: Implementation of an InterfaceAdding an interface Inheritance Name Interface name Advanced : Extends the interface which you select in the input field or via the Input Assistant . This means that all methods of the interface that extend the new interface are also available in the new interface. For more information, see: Extension of an interfaceMultiple inheritance is supported for interfaces. You can add the Interface Property and Interface Method objects to the ITF object. Interface methods may contain only the declarations of input, output and VAR_IN_OUT variables, but no implementation. So that you can also use an interface in the program, there must be a function block that implements this interface. This means: The function block contains the interface in its IMPLEMENTS list in its declaration part The function block contains an implementation for all methods and property prototypes of the interface A function block can implement one or more interfaces. You can use the same method with identical parameters, but different implementation code in different function blocks. Note the following: You must not define variables within an interface. An interface has no implementation part and no actions. Only a collection of methods is defined, in which you may define only input, output and VAR_IN_OUT variables. CODESYS always treats variables declared with the type of an interface as references. A function block that implements an interface must contain implementation code for the methods of the interface. You have named the methods exactly as in the interface and the methods contain the same input, output and VAR_IN_OUT variables as in the interface. Interface references and online change The following can happen with a compiler version < 3.4.1.0: If a function block changes its data because variables are added or deleted, or because the type of variables changes, then CODESYS copies all instances of the function block to a new memory location. In this case, however, an interface reference refers not to the new memory location, but still to the old one. In case of compiler versions >= 3.4.1.0, CODESYS automatically re-addresses the interface references so that CODESYS also references the correct interface in case of an online change. CODESYS requires additional code and more time for this, so that jitter problems can occur depending on the number of objects concerned. Therefore, CODESYS displays the number of variables and interface references concerned before the execution of the online change and you can then decide whether the online change should be executed or aborted. Example Definition of an interface and its use in a function block You have inserted the interface ITF below the application. The interface contains the methods Method1 and Method2 . ITF , Method1 and Method2 contain no implementation code. You insert the required variable declarations only in the declaration part of the methods. If you subsequently insert a function block in the device tree that implements the interface ITF , CODESYS automatically also inserts the methods Method1 and Method2 under the function block. Here you can implement function-block-specific code in the methods. " },

Monitoring of properties in online mode The following pragmas are provided for the monitoring of properties in online mode. You insert them at the top position of the property definition: {attribute 'monitoring' := 'variable'} Each time the property is accessed, CODESYS saves the actual value to a variable and displays the value of this variable. This value can become outdated if no more access to the property takes place in the code. {attribute 'monitoring' := 'call'} Each time the value is displayed, CODESYS calls the code of the Get accessor.

The object can be used for mapping the executable code of an application in different code areas on the controller. Specifically small controllers often have limited internal code areas (flash memory). If one or more additional code areas (for example, external flash memory) are available on the controller, then the location of the code POUs of an application can be changed specifically. In the case of a safety controller (SIL2), this can also be used for moving non-safety-relevant code POUs or entire libraries into this external memory. If there are no specific requirements, then the code POUs are stored sequentially in the code areas ( default ). This means that the next code POUs are stored in the next areas only when the first code area is filled. In the POU Locations editor, you will see the current location of the POUs in the memory areas and you can change them specifically. Especially in the case of a safety application, this may be necessary for getting all safe POUs into the safe internal memory area.

For example, if the name Company_A is specified in Company , then the Company key with the value Company_A is provided on the Properties tab. If you save your project as a library project, then you should pay attention to the guidelines for library developers . For a library project, a Company , a Title , and a Version must be specified to install the library.

If you reply to this prompt one time by clicking Yes , then no additional prompts appear for more editing actions. Library Categories Categories of the library project, according to which you can sort in the Library Repository dialog If no category is specified, then the category Other is assigned to the library. The categories originate from one or more external description files in XML format. However, they can also originate from a library project that has already been created. Requirement: The project is a library project. : The Library Categories dialog opens where you can add library categories. For more information about creating library categories, see: Library Categories Default namespace Requirement: The project is a library project. If you do not define a default namespace here, then the name of the library file is applied automatically as the namespace. Placeholder Requirement: The project is a library project. Placeholder name used for the reference to this library Example: SysMem References which function via placeholders are displayed according to the syntax #<placeholder name> . Important: The name of a placeholder can no longer be changed. Therefore, it is highly recommended to choose a name in which the probability is low that someone else will choose it exactly the same. Hint: You can integrate referenced libraries via library placeholders. This way you avoid the problems that could occur due to version dependencies or the necessity to use vendor-specific libraries.

When the Save Project as command is executed again, the saved selection is then selected by default. If you have activated this option and add an object which requires a newer storage format, then a dialog opens. In the dialog, you need to explicitly confirm or cancel the update. If you click Yes , then all changes in the project are saved without data loss. However, in the future the project can no longer be opened with the originally set storage format. The new format is defined as the new enforced storage format. If you click No , then the project remains compatible with the set storage format, but not all changes may be saved. The Enforce project compatibility to option is useful for the development of compatible libraries. At the same time, this makes it possible to use the latest version of the programming system. Effects if this option is activated: The request to update the storage format is suppressed. Newer features which need to be saved in the project cannot be used. For the strict development of libraries, which only contain textual objects (such as POUs, DUTs, and interfaces), this is not a constraint.

"body" : "Object: Task Configuration You define task groups on the Task Groups tab. Task groups can be distributed over the individual processor cores in Multicore systems. The tasks of a task group are bound to the processor cores according to the strategy defined in the Core field. In the Priority column, the priority of the task is displayed as it is configured in the editor of the respective IEC task. Add Group The button adds a new task group named NewGroup_<no> . Remove Group Deletes the selected task group. Group Name The name can be changed by double-clicking in the field. Core Free floating : All IEC tasks in the task group are dynamically distributed to the individual processor cores by the operating system via load balancing. This means that the tasks usually very often switch the processor cores where they are executed. The user has no control over this. We recommend this setting for most applications because the load is automatically distributed by the operating system. Sequentially pinned : All IEC tasks of the task group are permanently bound to different processor cores. If there are fewer processor cores than tasks, then the tasks are bound to the individual processor cores, starting with Core1 and continuing with Core2, Core3, etc. In the event of an overflow, the process is continued with Core0, Core, etc. The user has no control over this. Fixed pinned : All IEC tasks of the task group are permanently bound to a processor core. By default, the runtime determines the processor core. Core1 is usually used. If there are several task groups with the Fixed pinned setting, then each task group is bound to a different processor core. This usually starts with Core1. <fixed core number> all IEC tasks of the task group are permanently bound to a defined processor core. If the processor core does not exist on the controller, then an error is generated during the download. The Sequentially pinned , Fixed pinned , and <fixed core number> settings can be helpful to obtain more deterministic jitter times. This is because these settings are not influenced by the dynamic distribution of tasks to the individual cores at runtime. However, this prevents the operating system from distributing the load across the individual processor cores. Therefore, we recommend these settings only after testing them first. This test should demonstrate that these settings allow for a significantly improved real-time behavior. " },

Note: Deviations of the task from this desired task cycle time are displayed at runtime as periodic jitter on the Tab: Monitoring tab. Time unit of the interval If only a number and not a time definition is specified in the Interval input field, then the unit selected here determines the time dimensions. Example: ms Note: A task cycle time in µs is always displayed as a number. Type: Event Processing of the task starts event-triggered on the rising edge of the event variable. Input field: Event Global variable (Boolean type) The task starts as soon as the variable value switches from 0 to 1. Type: External Processing of the task starts event-triggered on the rising edge of the event variable. List box: Event List with target system-dependent events (Boolean type) Note: The target system determines which events are supported and offered in the list box. Hint: Not to be confused with system events Interval Time definition in TIME# format or as a number with a time unit Note: Only available when the event requires a time definition Type: Freewheeling Processing of the task restarts automatically in a continuous loop at program start and after the end of a run after a certain waiting time Important: After completing a run, a certain amount of time is waited before the task is executed again. The duration is a percentage of the last cycle duration. Note: You do not define a cycle time. Type: Status Processing of the task starts state-triggered by the event variables Input field: Event Global variable (Boolean type) When the variable has the state TRUE , the task starts freewheeling. The task runs until the variable gets the value FALSE . Note: The variable is typically reset in the task itself. In contrast to the event task, no event can be missed in this way. When an event occurs, the scheduler must save an old value, and this can change more often than it is checked. So if an event variable changes to TRUE only for a short time, the scheduler might not detect this change. This can be avoided with a status task. The status variable is set to TRUE by some other task and reset by the status task. This makes sure that the task is executed once each time it switches to TRUE . For fieldbuses, a fixed cycle matrix is necessary to assure a determined behavior. Therefore, you should not use the Freewheeling type for a bus cycle task. Note the following difference between the processing types Status and Event : if the given event yields TRUE , then the start condition of a task of type Status is fulfilled. In contrast, the start of a task of type Event requires a switch of the event from FALSE to TRUE . If the sampling rate of the task scheduler is too low, then the rising edge of the event can remain unnoticed. When setting the task cycle time, you need to identify which bus system is currently being used. For example, the task cycle time in a CAN bus system must match the currently set baud rate and the number of frames used in the bus. In addition, the times set for heartbeat, node guarding, and sync should always be a multiple of the task cycle time. If not, then CAN frames can be lost.

"body" : "Defines the time monitoring for a task. If the target system supports an advanced watchdog configuration, then the following settings may be predefined in the device description. Upper and lower limit Default watchdog time Time specified as percentage The default watchdog settings depend on the device. Enable : The watchdog is active. If the task exceeds the currently set time of the watchdog, then the task is halted with an error status (exception). The application in whose task the error occurred and its child applications are also halted. In this way, all tasks of the affected applications are also halted. Then the currently defined Sensitivity is also taken into account. If you activate the option Update I\/Os in the PLC Settings of the PLC, then CODESYS resets the outputs to the defined default values. Possible cases: Multiple consecutive timeouts: Sensitivity: 0, 1 – exception in cycle 1 Sensitivity: 2 – exception in cycle 2 Sensitivity: n – exception in cycle n Single timeout: Exception if the cycle time of the current cycle is longer than (time * sensitivity). Example: Time=t#10ms, Sensitivity=5 (i.e., exception as soon as the one-time task runs longer than 50 ms). Time (e.g. t#200ms) Watchdog time Defines (together with Sensitivity ) the watchdog for a task; description as for Enable . Depending on the target system, the monitoring time span is given as a percentage of the task interval if possible. In this case, the list box for the unit is disabled and displays % . Sensitivity Number Defines (together with the watchdog) the watchdog for a task; description as for Enable . Using the functions from the library CmpIecTask.library , you can deactivate a watchdog for specific PLC cycles. This is useful for cycles that demand more time due to initialization. Example Deactivating\/reactivating the watchdog: VAR\nhIecTask : RTS_IEC_HANDLE;\nEND_VAR\n\nhIecTask := IecTaskGetCurrent(0);\nIecTaskDisableWatchdog(hIecTask); \/\/Watchdog disabled\n...\nIecTaskEnableWatchdog(hIecTask); \/\/Watchdog enabled The watchdog is deactivated before initialization with IecTaskDisableWatchDog for the rest of the cycle and is automatically reactivated at the next cycle. The watchdog can be reactivated after initialization with IecTaskEnableWatchDog . The watchdog is then already reactivated for the rest of the cycle (the watchdog time window starts again from the beginning). Initializations of function blocks which happen within the FB_Init method are not affected by this. But there was the limit of < 30 seconds because of the communication timeout. This time limit no longer exists since V3.5 SP18 because the online services are executed asynchronously. The normal watchdog of an IEC task is triggered when the execution time of the IEC task exceeds the watchdog time. The \"Omitted Cycle\" watchdog is triggered when the task does not start at all. This is the case when the task does not execute any cycle at all within the maximum of < Time * Sensitivity > or <2 * Interval >. The cause could be crowding by other tasks or a failure in the scheduler, which no longer enables the task. " },

The storage format of a project is displayed in the project Information ( Project → Project Information , File tab). Before you save a project as a library: Make sure that the rules for creating libraries have been followed. If it is to be possible to configure global constants provided by the library at a later time in an application, then define them in a parameter list. A parameter list is a special type of global variable list. When you save the project, no automatic check for errors is performed. Different from CoDeSys V2.3 , there is no distinction between \"external\" and \"internal\" libraries. Now, in the properties of each individual project object, you can define whether or not the object should be treated as \"external\". Think about whether the created library should be immediately installed in the system library repository. If so, then use the Save Project and Install in the Library Repository command. If you want to protect the library project from later changes, then set the Released attribute in the Project Information dialog. When the next attempt is made to save the project, a corresponding message will be displayed and the user will have to react to the write protection with deliberate actions.

If the Enforce signing of compiled libraries option is selected in the Security Screen view on the User tab, then a library project has to be provided with a digital certificate-based signature when being saved. When a suitable certificate is available, it is provided in the Security Screen on the User tab in the Digital Signature section. In the Project Information , on the Summary tab, a Library compatibility with a CODESYS version >= 3.5 SP15 is set by default. In this case, the project file is saved with the .compiled-library-v3 file extension when it is saved as a compiled and signed library. If you still have not specified a suitable valid certificate for your user profile in the Security Screen , then a dialog prompt opens next for you to do this. Afterwards, you can run the save command again. In all other respects, compiled library files behave just like *.library files, and therefore they can be installed and referenced with the same steps. We recommend that you use libraries which are compiled and signed with certificates. Besides the protection of the source code and the unauthorized use of a library, less memory is also used which therefore results in shorter loading times. If you have the corresponding help files with translations, then in CODESYS V 3.5 SP15 and later you can extend the library documentation with the translation into other languages as follows: Place the __lmd__<language>.aux files created for the new languages in a <library name>.lmd directory parallel to the <library name>.compiled-library-v3 library project. If the files are correct, then they are included in the compiled library file when the library project is saved by means of the Save Project as Compiled Library command. Example: The standard.lmd directory exists parallel to the standard.compiled-library-v3 library file and contains the __lmd__fr.aux file with the French translation of the library documentation. After the compiled library is saved, the French version of the documentation is also available in the Library Manager.

Input field Symbol name (variable name, POU name, DUT name) – Input possibilities: Selection of a declared symbol by means of the Input Assistant ( button) Manual input of the symbol name Triggering of the search by pressing the button or the Enter key For the text search, you can use the placeholders \" * \" (any number of characters) or \" ? \" (exactly any one character) in combination with a partial string of a variable identifier. Use the percent sign \" % \" to search for IEC addresses. Examples: \" %MW8 \", \" %M* \" Use the Browse → Display Cross References command if the name of a declared symbol is selected in an editor, or if the cursor is in the name field. A search is also possible if the object is selected in the device tree or POU pool. Automatic if the name of a declared symbol is selected in an editor, or if the cursor is in the name field An automatic search is also possible if the object is selected in the device tree or POU pool. Requirement: The Automatically list selection in cross reference view option is selected in the SmartCoding category of the CODESYS Options. The following input is valid: Variable name; simple or qualified Examples: \" iVar \", \" PLC_PRG.iVar \" POU name Examples: \" PLC_PRG \", \" myFB \" DUT name Example: \" mySTRUCT \" Strings combined with placeholders \"*\" (any number of characters) or \"?\" (exactly one character) Example: \" iVar *\" applies to iVar1 , iVar_glob2 , iVar45 , etc. \" iVar? \" applies to iVar1 , iVar2 , iVarX , etc., but not iVar_glob2 , iVar45 , etc. \" %IEC <address> \": CODESYS searches for variables which are assigned to this address and direct memory access. Example: \" %QB0 \", %Q0 := 2 Open the Input Assistant for selecting a symbol Perform search Define columns to search for the string Input field String which is searched for in the selected columns The result locations are highlighted in yellow. Cross references without this string are hidden. Show source position of previous cross reference ( Shift + F4 ) Show source position of next cross reference ( F4 ) Limit Results to Current Declaration Available when multiple declarations have been found for a symbol Restricts the display to the declaration that you have selected in the list Show source position of selected cross reference The focus jumps to the occurrence location of the symbol. Print cross reference list The default dialog for setting up a print job opens. The cross references are displayed with the following information: Symbol The result locations for the symbols (variables, POUs, or DUTs) are grouped by declaration. The declaration occurrence comprises the root node and the occurrence locations in the project are indented below. Exactly that expression is displayed which has the symbol at the occurrence location. Example: If there is a global variable i in the project and a local declared variable i in a POU, then two root node entries will be listed after a text search for cross references with the occurrences of the variable i below each. POU POU name, DUT name; also for example a task name in the case that a POU call is in the task configuration Variable Purely a variable name Example: iVar Access Type of access to the variable at the occurrence location: Declaration \/ Read \/ Write \/ Call Special case for pointers An assignment of type p := ADR(var1) is displayed as Write | Address when searching for var1 . The reason for this is that any write access to p is not displayed when searching for var1 . Write access is also possible by means of pointer variables. Type Data type of the variable Address IEC address in the case that variables are assigned Example: \" AT %QB0 \" Position Location of the occurrence in the POU editor, for example line number, network number, declaration part, or implementation part Example: \" Line 1, Column 1 (Impl) \" Object POU name plus full path of the occurrence location in brackets (in the case that this is found in the Devices view) Example: \" PLC_PRG [Device:Plc Logic:Application] \" Comment Comment in the case that it is available in the declaration of the variable The search yields all result locations in the project and in integrated, uncompiled libraries.

"body" : "Scan for Devices Function : The command establishes a temporary connection to the hardware and detects the devices in the network. Then you can apply the scanned devices into the device tree of your project. Call : Project menu; context menu of a device object in the device tree Requirement : The communication settings to the controller are correct. The gateway and the PLC are started. The device supports the scan function. The following devices provide the scan function: EtherCAT Master, EtherNet\/IP Scanner (IEC), Sercos Master, CANopen Manager, CANopen Manager SIL2, Profinet Controller, and Profibus DP Master. You can perform the device scan immediately if the scan function is permanently implemented in the PLC. When the scan function is implemented in a library, you have to log in only one time to download the library to the controller. The command applies to the master controller selected in the device tree. For example, a PROFINET IO Controller which is already inserted can be selected, and the command used to detect the I\/O devices and I\/O modules assigned to it. After performing the scan operation, the Scan Devices dialog opens and displays the scanned devices. The dialogs for the scan differ depending on the type of device. See the help pages for the respective device editor. Scanned Devices Device name, Device type, Address, Station name, etc. Data about the scanned device depending on network type When you change a value in the list of scanned devices, the value is displayed in italics. This indicates that the new value has been changed in the editor in CODESYS , but not in the device. When you download the value to the device, it is displayed normally. Values which indicate differences between the project and the scanned device are displayed in orange. If multiple device descriptions are available for the scanned device, then the name is displayed in bold. The selection of the matching device description is resolved differently for different fieldbuses. For more detailed information, see the corresponding fieldbus chapters. If a device description cannot be found, then the following message is shown: \"Attention! The device was not found in the repository.\" Depending on the bus system, additional information is displayed, such as vendor number and product number. The device cannot be inserted into the project without the installed device description. Show differences to project : The table in the dialog also shows additional configured devices (in the device tree of the project). : The table shows all scanned devices. The configured devices are not shown. Scan for Devices Starts a new scan Copy All Devices to Project The device which is selected in the table is inserted into the device tree in the project. If nothing is selected, then all scanned devices are shown. If you use Copy All Devices to Project to insert devices, which are available in the device tree, to the device tree, then the following should be noted: The data of the Process Data and <...> I\/O Mapping tabs of the existing devices may be overwritten with the data of the recently inserted devices. Configured Devices This part of the dialog is visible only when you select the Show differences to project option. Differences between the scanned and configured devices are color-coded. Devices displayed in green are identical on both sides. Devices displayed in red are available only in the view of the scanned or configured devices. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted above the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the scanned devices are inserted below the selected configured device. If you have selected a device in both views, then the configured devices are replaced by the selected scanned device. All scanned devices are copied to the project. The selected configured device is deleted. For more information, see: Mapping a Hardware Structure in the Device Tree" },

"body" : "Online Change Function : The command is used to trigger an online change on the current application. When this is done, CODESYS re-downloads only the changed parts of an application which is already running on the controller. Call : Online menu; context menu of an Application object Requirement : The application is in online mode. The command is available in the context menu when an application is selected in the device tree. As a result, you can perform an online change just for one application, even if that application is not currently \"active\". An online change modifies the running application program and does not cause a restart. Make sure that the new application code still has the required effect on the controlled system. Depending on the controlled plant, this could result in damage to the plant or the workpieces, or injury or death of personnel. When an online change is performed, the application-specific initializations (example: homing) are not executed because the machine retains its status. For this reason, the new program code may not have the intended effect. Variables to pointers retain their value from the last cycle. When a pointer refers to a variable whose value was changed in an online change, the variable no longer yields the correct value. Make sure that the pointers are re-assigned in each cycle. After you have changed the \"parent application\", a \"child application\" is removed from the controller when an online change is performed. No initialization code during a fast online change Since compiler version >= 3.5.0.0, a \"fast online change\" is performed for minor changes. During a fast online change, only the modified POUs are compiled and downloaded. In particular, no initialization code is generated. For variables with the init_on_onlchange attribute, this also results in no initialization code being generated. In the usual scenarios, that has no impact because the attribute is usually used to initialize variables with addresses. However, during a fast online change, it cannot happen that a variable changes its address. However, to make sure of the impact of the init_on_onlchange attribute is applied in the entire application code, in general for the application you can use the no_fast_online_change compiler define to disable the fast online change. To do this, select your application object in the device tree and click Properties in the context menu. Below the Build tab, add the no_fast_online_change compiler define. For more information, see: BuildAt the time of download, CODESYS also lists the changed interfaces, affected variables, and all POUs with new generated code in the Build category of the message view. If memory locations change, a dialog will notify you of possible problems relating to pointers. In the Online Change Memory Reserve view, memory reserves can be configured for the online change so that instance variables do not have to be moved in the memory when changing a function block in an online change.

"body" : "Operating Mode – Debug, Locked, and Operational Function : The commands set the controller to a state which prevents an accidental change to the project. Call : Online menu You can use these commands, for example, to lock the state of a controller in order to prevent the controller from switching to another state while you program another controller. When programming is complete, the controller should then be switched to a defined and externally visible state which is set exactly the same way after restarting. The , , and symbols in the status bar indicate the current operating mode. Double-clicking one of these symbols opens a help window. If the controller supports it, then you can switch the controller to the following operating modes: : Debug No restrictions : Locked The current state of debugging is locked on the application. No additional breakpoints can be set and no additional variables can be forced. Writing variables is still possible and breakpoints which are already set remain enabled. Only the \"RUN\" state of an application is preserved in Locked mode, even when the controller is restarted. With this operating mode, developers can be prevented from changing the application on the controller, for example by setting or deleting a breakpoint, by forcing, or by making changes to the file system. This operating mode is helpful to prevent a download to an incorrect controller when, for example, multiple controllers of a plant are programmed. : Operational This operating mode makes sure that the controller reloads the same applications after a restart and that no debug features are enabled anymore. The operating mode is set when a controller is completely programmed and should be accepted or already is. Conditions for enabling Operational mode: A boot application for each application has to exist on the controller. There must not be any active breakpoints set. All applications have to be running. There must not exist any forced values. Furthermore, the device can define more of its own restrictions. The Locked and Operational modes are different in the use cases and in the requirements for enabling the mode. However, for both operating modes the runtime system prevents the following actions: Regarding the application Download of an application Online Change Force variables Set breakpoints Stop application Reset application Start application Delete application Regarding the file transfer of the controller Download of a file to the controller Delete a file on the controller Rename a file on the controller Create a directory on the controller Delete a directory on the controller Rename a directory on the controller You cannot switch the operating mode between Locked and Operational .

Placeholder resolutions can also be defined in the target device which is currently in use and even by a specific local specification in the 'Placeholders' dialog in the Library Manager. If you want to load a project with a compiler version < 3.5.18.0, then it is advantageous to install a CODESYS with a suitable version and to start the project with it.

You can change the namespace for the open project. Example: LA Default Library which triggers the placeholder when no other trigger is defined or possible Requirement: The selected library is a library placeholder, and therefore the setting is available. Note: For compiler version 3.5.8.0 and higher, the following applies in the case of library placeholders with a resolution in the device description which are located in the Library Manager of the POUs view: This placeholder is always resolved automatically according to the description of the device which compiles the application. If the selected library is developed in compliance with the \"Guidelines for Developing Libraries\", then we do not recommend that you change the following settings. Version Selection of the version constraint Requirement: The settings are available only if the selected library is not a library placeholder. Note: Container and interface libraries are automatically created with library references with version constraint. Whenever possible, do not create libraries which include library references with a version constraint. Instead, you use placeholders to reference the libraries. Edit a placeholder resolution in the Placeholders dialog. Exact version : The version which was selected from list box is integrated into the project. Note: This option is strongly recommended for container libraries, and it is usually preset for this library type. Always newest version : The library repository is scanned and the newest detected version is integrated. Note: If a newer library version is available, then the library POUs which are actually used can change. This option is strongly recommended for interface libraries, and it is usually preset for this library type. Visibility Allow only qualified access to all identifiers : Library POUs (and variables) are called in the project only with prepended namespace paths. When the current project is referenced as a library in another project Note: Changing the following settings makes sense only if you have created a library with your project and therefore opened a library project. As a result, the selected library is referenced in the new library. Make visible all IEC symbols in the project if is this reference were directly integrated here. : As a container library, the selected library makes the contents of the referenced library visible at the top level (later in a project). Requirement: A container project is created with a library project. A container library does not implement its own POUs, but exclusively references other libraries. It bundles libraries. A container library can be reasonably used to bundle multiple libraries (in a reference) in a project. This option has to be enabled for each library reference. Symbolic access to library POUs: <namespace of container library>.<POU name> : The contents of the referenced library are uniquely accessed by means of the namespace. The path name consists of the library name and the unique name (library reference), and it is prepended to the POU name. Requirement: No container project is created with a library project. Do not show this reference in the dependency tree. : The selected library is not displayed (later in a project) in the Library Manager as a library reference. The library is a hidden reference. Warning: If there are compile errors resulting from hidden library errors, then it may be difficult to detect the errors. : The selected library is displayed (later in a project) as a library reference. Optional (if the library is missing, no error will be reported). : The selected library is handled as optional. When downloading the project which references the library, no error is reported, even if the library is not available in the library repository. For more information, see: Placeholders" },

Delete Deletes the selected configuration setting Move Up , Move Down Moves the selected configuration entry one position up or down Possible block driver interfaces COM Port Serial port on the device, for example for data exchange according to the RS232 standard on a COM port intended for this purpose Possible configuration settings: Name : Symbolic only Port : Physical serial port which is used for this interface, for example COM 5 on a Windows computer Baud rate : 2400 , 4800 , 9600 , 19200 , 38400 , 57600 , 115200 Activate auto addressing : (default = ) The Local address setting is evaluated. Both devices, which communicate via the serial port, will independently negotiate their addresses before they begin exchanging messages. If the addresses of both devices are the same, then they are negotiated again. This setting is useful when the local addresses cannot be set explicitly, for example for devices which are physically separated. Local address : Evaluated only when Enable auto addressing is activated Default = actual value for port Shared Memory Shared memory driver Possible settings: Name : Symbolic only Forced address : Default = -1 (= no forced address ) Example: 42 means that the driver has to use the fixed address defined here and that addresses are assigned freely in the range 0 – 255 . This setting can be useful when more than one shared memory driver is activated in the configuration. Ethernet UDP\/IP Ethernet interface for data exchange according to the \"User Datagram Protocol\" Possible settings: Name : Symbolic only Port index : Port number for the communication Port indices are in the range 0 – 3 . They are mapped to the following Ethernet port: 1740 – 1743 . IP address : Default = 127.0.0.1 This setting can be useful to explicitly set an interface when the device has multiple network interfaces. Example: 127.0.0.1 stands for some local network interface, also known as localhost . Every other address (for example, 10.27.7.72 ) represents a real IP address which has to be available on the device. Network mask : Default = 255.255.255.0 Example: 255.255.252.0 This setting can be useful to explicitly set an interface when the device has multiple network interfaces. PPP address : Default = 127.0.0.1 Example: 10.13.42.240 Establishes a logical point-to-point connection between the UDP interface and the node named with the address specified here Causes the UDP interface to communicate exclusively with this node and no broadcasts to be sent in the network Ethernet TCP\/IP Ethernet interface for data exchange according to the \"Transmission Control Protocol\" Possible settings: Name , Port , IP address : See Ethernet UDP\/IP above Inactivity timeout : Default = 0 This setting defines the time span (in seconds) after which the TCP connections are closed when data is no longer exchanged.

Call : Context menu of the selected function block (FB) in the device tree Requirement : The function block implements an interface which you have changed. For example, an additional method has been added to the interface. In object-oriented programming, if you derive a function block (FB) from a base function block, which implements one or more interfaces for the purpose of inheritance, then the following applies: When you execute the Implement interfaces command for the derived FB, all interface methods and interface attributes of the base FB are applied to the derived FB in the form of \"stubs\" (without implementation). Then you are responsible for making sure that an \"empty\" method or attribute in the derived FB does not conflict with an implemented one in the base FB. To help you with this: the following happens: If there is a base implementation for a method or attribute, then CODESYS adds an {error..} pragma attribute in the first line of the relevant derived interface method or interface attribute which will generate the error message. If there is not a base implementation for the method or attribute, then it provides a pragma attribute entry for a warning. After editing the POU, you have to explicitly remove the error pragma attribute entry. For more information, see: Implementation of an Interface" },

List identifier Used to identify the network variable list Has to be unique Pack variables The size of the packages (telegrams) that are transmitted depends on the network type. In the case of UDP , a package is 256 bytes. : CODESYS bundles the variables for sending in packages in order to reduce as much as possible the number of packages to send. In the case of variables of type array or structured data types, this can lead to the splitting of the variables into multiple telegrams. As a result, data inconsistencies are possible within these variables, even if the variable size is smaller than the package size. : CODESYS generates one package per variable. Transmit checksum : A checksum is provided for each variable package. The receiver checks the checksum to make sure that the variable definitions match from the sender and receiver. A package with conflicting checksums is not accepted. Acknowledgment : CODESYS sends an acknowledgment message for each received data package. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment before it sends again, then an error is written to the diagnostic structure. Note: For the NetVarUdp library version 3.5.7.0 and higher, a receiver channel is no longer assigned when acknowledged transfer is not selected. As a result, network variable exchange is also possible between two controllers on one hardware device. Cyclic transmission , Interval CODESYS sends the variables within the defined interval. Example for time definition: \"T#70ms\" Transmit on change , Minimum gap : CODESYS sends the variables only if their values have changed. You can use \"minimum gap\" to define the least amount of time between two transmissions. Transmit on event , Variable : CODESYS sends the variables as soon as the defined variable yields TRUE . Settings Protocol-specific settings Possible entries depend on the network library: Port : Number of the port which CODESYS uses for data exchange with other network units The Default value is \"1202\". You can change the current value at any time in the Value field: Select the field, press the Space Bar , and specify the value. Caution : The other nodes in the network have to define the same port. If more than one UDP connection is defined in the project, then the port numbers in all configurations are adapted to this value. Broadcast Adr. : The Default value is 255.255.255.255, which means that data exchange will take place with all network units. You can change the current value at any time in the Value field: Select the field, press the Space Bar , and specify the address or address range of a subnetwork.

During the compile process of an application, only the functions blocks\/programs\/functions which are actually used directly or indirectly by the application code are compiled.

Check all Pool Objects Pointer size to use If you save a POINTER variable in a DWORD variable in the library, then this library can be compiled only for 32-bit devices. To detect and avoid this problem, you can specify the pointer size which should be specified for the Check all Pool Objects command. You can select the following values: 32 Bit 64 Bit 32 and 64 Bit The following example shows how to use the Check all Pool Objects command to detect invalid assignments for the 64-bit pointer size: FUNCTION F : INT\nVAR\n               \nptr : POINTER TO BYTE;\n               \nptrSave : DWORD;\nEND_VAR\nptrSave := ptr; This assignment results in the error C0032: Type 'POINTER TO BYTE' can not be converted to type 'DWORD' .

An update to the newest compiler version is possible, but resetting to an older version is not possible. Settings Allow Unicode characters for identifiers Cleared by default because using Unicode characters in identifier names is not permitted in the IEC standard May be required for some foreign languages (example: Asian languages) Replace constants : (default) The value is loaded directly for every scalar constant (not for STRING , ARRAY , or structures). In online mode, the constants are marked with a symbol which is prepended to the value in the declaration editor or monitoring view. In this case, access is not possible, for example by means of an ADR operator, forcing, and writing. : Access to constants is possible, but it prolongs the computation time. Enable logging in breakpoints For breakpoints which are defined as execution points, you can create a message text in the Execution Point Settings dialog. This text is printed to the device log when the application halts at the execution point. UTF8 Encoding for STRING : Strings with the STRING data type are encoded in ASCII format project-wide. An index access to the literal works properly. : Strings with STRING data type are encoded in UTF-8 format project-wide. This applies to every STRING literal and is also used for their monitoring. Index access to the UTF-8 literal is not advisable and will mostly lead to errors. If project-wide encoding to UTF-8 format is not desired, a single variable type can be implicitly converted with a UTF8# prefix. UTF-8 encoding only for project-wide configuration A UTF-8 encoding is used if the project-wide compile option UTF8 encoding for STRING is enabled. Library functions and add-ons are then also oriented according to this setting. If you use single UTF-8 encoded strings, then you need to make sure that they are interpreted correctly wherever they are used. For example, a string variable in the OPC server will be converted to UTF-8 before being transferred to a client if the setting is not selected. Values such as UTF8#'äöü' would then be misinterpreted. Similar problems can arise when outputting strings in the visualization. Edit Project Defines Opens the Edit Project Defines dialog.

If you have not yet stored any mapping for a specific library, you have to redefine the mapping each time when you open an old project where this library is integrated. Call : Tools → Options command, Libraries category A mapping defines what a library reference looks like after the conversion of the project into the current format.

You replace one reference with another reference. This means that one of the installed libraries replaces the integrated library. You delete the reference. This means that the converted project no longer integrates the library. CODESYS applies all of the listed mappings to the library references of an old project the next time it is converted. Therefore, you have to repeat the mapping definition if the same library is integrated again in a project which is to be converted. You can enter a new mapping in the last line.

Underline Errors in the Editor : Incorrect or unknown program code is underlined. This option is used to enable or disable the precompile feature. It should be noted that not all errors are recognized in the precompile phase because no code is generated in this phase.  Unrecognized errors are especially those errors which occur when allocating the data, for example when the available memory for the data runs out. In addition, in the precompile phase errors can also occur which are not relevant when generating the code. One example of errors which are reported but are not relevant when generating code: problems which are reported in function blocks that are not used anywhere. If there is no instance of the type of a function block, then the compiler is not interested in this function block, but errors are still underlined in the editor. Highlight symbols : All occurrences of a symbol where the cursor is positioned are highlighted in color within the editor. As a result, cross references within the editor are quickly detected.

Explicit : You mark the code segment explicitly with comments that should be combined in one indentation unit: A comment with three opening braces \"{{{\" has to be before the segment, and a comment with three closing braces \"}}}\" has to be after the segment. The comments can contain additional text. Example: Word wrap Soft : The line break occurs at the edge of the editor window when 0 is specified for Wrap margin . Hard : The line break occurs after the number of characters specified for Wrap margin . Tab width Number of characters Keep tabs : CODESYS does not break up the spacing, which you have inserted by means of the Tab key, into individual spaces afterwards. Indent width If you have selected Smart or Smart with code completion for the AutoIndent option, then CODESYS inserts the number of spaces at the beginning of the line. AutoIndent None Block : A new line automatically applies the indentation of the previous line. Smart : Lines that follow a line which contains a keyword (for example, VAR ) indent automatically by the specified Indent width .

"body" : "The technical basis for each fieldbus device, which is configured in the device tree, is the I\/O driver. The I\/O driver is the link between the fieldbus stack, the IEC application, and the IDE. The driver configures the fieldbus stack from the data of the device configuration. It shows the diagnosis, provides an API for the IEC application, and is responsible for the I\/O mapping (see chapter \"I\/O Mapping\"). This chapter provides a brief overview of the basic functionality of I\/O driver devices, without discussing the details of specific bus systems. In addition, some recommendations for the configuration are provided. Multiple I\/O drivers and tasks (troubleshooting) If consistent access to I\/O data from multiple tasks and possibly across multiple I\/O driver instances has to be synchronized, then undesired reciprocal interference between the bus and application task may occur under certain circumstances. This is the case, for example, when the general system load is high or when the I\/O data of the real-time critical fieldbus system is used together with I\/O data of a slow and blocking local bus system in the same task. In case of unexpected interference of the communication, with the particularly real-time-critical fieldbuses (EtherCAT, Profinet, CAN), the task monitoring should therefore first be examined for very large jitter or outliers in the cycle time (maximum value compared to average value). The task list provides detailed information about the use of I\/O data in different tasks. It may be possible to avoid using I\/O data from different bus systems in one and the same task or to reduce the number of I\/O tasks. For more information, see: Tab: Task Deployment" },

Some I\/O drivers use multiple tasks: usually one real-time critical task (with high priority), which is used for the transfer of I\/O data, and another task with low priority for tasks such as evaluating diagnostics and executing acyclic services of the bus system. With real-time critical bus systems, it has to be ensured that no operations are executed in the context of this bus task that would interrupt the bus clock due to the execution time. The bus task can be configured in the I\/O mapping dialog of the I\/O driver device. Note that the settings of the parent device are inherited by default. If this device is the PLC, then its PLC setting applies in the bus cycle task. If this above setting is not set, then the task with the shortest cycle time is used. In this way, a non-real-time I\/O driver can be executed unintentionally in the task context of a real-time critical driver, thus interrupting its communication.

"body" : "An essential function of an I\/O driver is to update the I\/O mapping. This means the mapping of the I\/O data of the bus system to variables of the IEC application (and vice versa). The input\/output data is mapped cyclically by copy and conversion operations in both directions from the internal memory image of the bus system to IEC variables assigned to %I and %Q addresses. For the I\/O driver, there is no internal difference whether symbolic names or \"direct\" access to the %I and %Q addresses are used for this I\/O mapping. For the maintainability of the application, it is recommended to always use descriptive variable names (example: variable \"TemperatureReactor\" instead of \"%IW117\" access). The updating of the I\/O mapping can be set with Always update variables (globally in the PLC Settings or individually for each device in the I\/O mapping dialog): Disabled: Only I\/O data used in the application is mapped. This may improve performance by avoiding the copy operations, but may cause confusion if the I\/O data in the I\/O mapping dialog is not updated (the values are then grayed out). This setting is recommended for an application whose development has been completed. Enabled 1: All data is updated. Enabled 2: The availability of this option depends on the device description. Caution: For productive use in special cases only. As a result, inconsistent I\/O data may occur, because the bus cycle task reads\/writes this data while the application code uses it in other tasks.

Task configuration: Especially for real-time critical fieldbus systems such as Profinet, EtherCAT, or CAN, which depend on maintaining an exact send\/receive clock, it is recommended to use a separate bus cycle task with high priority. For less real-time-critical tasks (for example, visualization) a significantly lower priority should be selected than for the bus cycle task. In order to achieve maximum I\/O throughput with as little offset as possible, separate POUs can be executed in the bus task of the fieldbus system.

The implementation in the I\/O driver is decisive for additional transfer of the I\/O data. It is responsible for the time frame and time point that the actual transfer to the corresponding bus system occurs. The bus cycle task of the PLC can be defined globally for all fieldbuses in the PLC settings. For some fieldbuses, however, you can change this independent of the global setting. The task with the shortest cycle time is used as the bus cycle task (setting: unspecified in the PLC settings). The messages are normally sent on the bus in this task. Other tasks copy only the I\/O data from an internal buffer that is exchanged only with the physical hardware in the bus cycle task.

If an output is written in various tasks, then the status is undefined, as this can be overwritten in each case. If the same inputs are used in various tasks, then it is possible for the input to change during the processing of a task. This happens when the task is interrupted by a task with a higher priority and causes the process image to be read again. Remedy: At the beginning of the IEC task, copy the input variables to variables and then work only with the local variables in the rest of the code. Conclusion: Using the same inputs and outputs in several tasks does not make any sense and can lead to unexpected reactions in some cases.
