"body" : "The CODESYS OPC UA PubSub add-on provides the OPC UA PubSub SL library for the exchange of messages via the Pub\/Sub protocol as defined by rules of the OPC Foundation. In addition to Client\/Server communication, the communication via the OPC UA Pub\/Sub protocol also provides an additional capability to exchange data between the subscribers of a network in compliance with the rules of the OPC UA Foundation. The structure of the data (DataSet) can be freely defined and is agreed upon in advance between the sender and the receiver. This eliminates the need to transport additional (meta) data. Data is transferred via UDP\/IP with the help of the OPC UA PubSub SL library in compliance with the rules as defined for UADP. A \"Publisher\" publishes its data to an unknown number of \"Subscribers\". As a result, the sender and receiver do not know each other. That is why the number of receivers also does not have any repercussions for the sender. A reply to the sender as to whether or not its messages have reached the receivers cannot be sent via the protocol due to the nature of the protocol. If necessary, such a reply has to be managed in an application-specific way. The data is transferred in a binary format according to the rules of the OPC Foundation. The OPC UA PubSub SL library handles the conversion of IEC data types into the corresponding OPC UA data types and back. Download and Licensing You can download the CODESYS OPC UA PubSub add-on from the CODESYS Store International and install it via the CODESYS Installer . The library can be used directly on some controllers, while for other controllers an SL license must be installed on the controller. Use the Device License Reader to find out if your controller has the required license. You can purchase a license in the CODESYS Store . Installation After installing the package, you will find the OPC UA PubSub SL Example.project sample project in the selected installation target directory. This project shows how to use the library. See the help for the sample project to get general information about communication via the OPC UA Pub\/Sub protocol, the contents of the library, and its usage: Using the OPC UA PubSub SL Library For more information, see the following: OPC UA PubSub SL library documentation CODESYS OPC UA PubSub contains only the OPC UA PubSub SL function block libraries. A configurator, as in the case of fieldbus protocols, is not implemented. " }
