Reading of coils and discrete inputs \/ Writing of coils to overlapping register memory The CODESYS MODBUS I\/O driver allows for the reading of coils and discrete inputs, as well as the writing of coils to overlapping register memory (the Discrete Bit Areas check box not selected). In this case, the first 8 bits which are read (%IB0) or written align with the high byte of the corresponding register. The second 8 bits which are read (%IB1) align with the low byte of the corresponding register (LSB first). Example In the following example, the first line defines a combined read\/write operation (function code 23). It reads a word from the holding register with offset 16#0001 and writes two words to the register with offset 16#0003 . The operation is performed as soon as the trigger variable defined on the I\/O Mapping tab shows a rising edge. " },

Inputs (VAR_INPUT) Name Data Type Initial Value Description Slave ModbusSlaveComPort xExecute BOOL Rising edge: The action starts. Falling edge: The outputs are reset when a falling edge occurs before the function block has ended the action. The outputs behave as usual and are reset only if the action is ended or has been aborted ( xAbort ), or if an error has occurred. In this case, the corresponding output values ( xDone , xError , iError ) exist at the outputs for exactly one cycle. xAbort BOOL TRUE : The action is aborted immediately and all outputs are set to their initial values. iChannelIndex INT The channel index to be executed. An invalid index leads to xError = TRUE (without Modbus-specific error code).

"body" : "The tab contains the basic settings for network communication in the network. Configured Parameters Watchdog : Activates the watchdog function. The incoming data (holding registers \/ %I range) is set to zero when the Modbus device does not receive any valid query from the client. Closing the TCP socket : If the watchdog is enabled and the set time is exceeded, then the TCP socket will be closed.

Only Modbus requests which have been sent to this IP address are received. : The server socket of the Modbus Server is not bound to an IP address. All Modbus requests are processed, which have been received by the system (on the Modbus port). Holding registers (%IW) Number of holding registers: possible values: 1–4096.

Input registers (%QW) Number of input registers: possible values: 1–4096. The maximum number can be limited in the device description. Discrete Bit Areas The Modbus coils and discrete inputs get their own data area. By default, the register access and bit access use the same Modbus data. Coils Number of Modbus coils Discrete inputs Number of Modbus discrete inputs Changes to the input\/output assembly size have a direct effect on the number of configurable parameters in the I\/O mapping.
