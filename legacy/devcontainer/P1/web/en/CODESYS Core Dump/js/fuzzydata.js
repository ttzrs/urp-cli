"body" : "A core dump is a memory snapshot of the application data. Runtime systems which support the functionality automatically place a core dump on the controller in the event of an exception error. It is stored in an <application name>.core file in the application directory. In online mode, you can also generate a core dump explicitly if the application is currently stopped at breakpoint or if an exception has occurred. In this case, CODESYS stores the core dump file in the project directory and not on the controller. In offline mode, you can load the core dump from the PLC to the project. Then an online view of the application is displayed with the data and values at the time of the exception. In addition, you can call a project view of the PLC log file at the time of generating the core dump. The runtime system must completely support this functionality in order to assure a correct display of variable values in the core dump view. In the online view of the application which CODESYS created when loading the core dump into the project, menu commands are displayed as available but do not have any effect in this status. When selecting one of these commands, a message is displayed. Restriction: The exception handling in the runtime system may overwrite parts of the variable values in the call stack. Therefore, the original values are lost and important information may no longer be displayed for variables in functions and methods at the time of monitoring. For creating a project archive: If you have created a core dump explicitly by clicking Create Core Dump , then this option is available automatically in the archive configuration. On the other hand, if you copied the core dump from the PLC, then you can add it to a project archive only by clicking Additional Files . Warning: A project archive with a core dump necessarily has to include the download information. If it does not, then CODESYS cannot use the core dump later. " },

"body" : "Create Core Dump Function : The command triggers CODESYS to check whether or not a core dump file already exists on the controller. If a core dump file exists, then CODESYS lets you load this file to the project directory. With the following requirements, CODESYS generates a new dump file with the current application data: A core dump file does not exist yet or CODESYS has rejected a core dump file from being loaded. AND: The application is currently stopped at breakpoint or an exception has been thrown. The generated core dump file is saved directly to the project directory: <project name>.<device name>.<application name>.<GUID of the application>.core . You can cancel the file generation by clicking the button in the status bar. The amount of detail in the core dump depends on the support from the runtime system. Runtime systems which are suitable for this purpose generate just one dump in the case of an exception error.
