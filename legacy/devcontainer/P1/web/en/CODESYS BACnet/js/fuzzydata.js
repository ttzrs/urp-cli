"body" : "BACnet is a standardized data communication protocol for B uilding A utomation and C ontrol net works as defined in the ANSI\/ASHRAE Standard 135 and ISO 16484-5. The BACnet protocol defines \"Services\" to allow communication between devices. Examples include Who-Is , I-Am , Who-Has , and I-Have for device and object search and identification, as well as Read-Property and Write-Property for the exchange of data. The BACnet protocol defines a number of \"Object\" types on which the services operate. Each object is characterized by its \"Properties\". The BACnet objects are combined in a BACnet \"device\". A BACnet \"device\" represents the functionality of a physical device. Integration allows access to the properties of BACnet objects and the configuration parameters of a BACnet device by means of an IEC application. You can program a dynamic BACnet configuration and have access to the BACnet functions in the BACnet network by reading and writing BACnet object properties. Support of the BACnet Standards ASHRAE 135-2012 AND ASHRAE 135-2020 The BACnet integration in CODESYS implements both ANSI\/ASHRAE Standard 135-2012 (\"protocol revision 14\/15\") and ANSI\/ASHRAE 135-2020 (\"protocol revision 25\") and is based on the AMEV recommendations AS-A and AS-B. CODESYS BACnet2 SL Version <=1.7.x.x implements the functionality standardized in BACnet standard ASHRAE 135-2012, supports protocol revision 14\/15, and is referred to as \" CODESYS BACnet(1) SL (major version 1)\" for better differentiation. CODESYS BACnet2 SL Version>=2.0.0.0 implements the functionality standardized in BACnet standard ASHRAE 135-2020, supports protocol revision 25, and is referred to as \" CODESYS BACnet2 SL (major version 2)\" for better differentiation. The extensions and changes made since version 1.7.0.0 from standard ASHRAE 135-2012 to standard ASHRAE 135-2020 are so extensive that a complete compatibility from the point of view of the application – depending on the BACnet functional scope used – is not guaranteed. Therefore, the package contains the libraries for accessing the respective runtime system component for both protocols. The libraries for the support of protocol revision 25 ( CODESYS BACnet2 SL ) are named accordingly (for example, BACnet2 and CmpBACnet2 ). The documentation displayed in the Library Manager or the BACnet2 Library online help provides a detailed description. For new developments, priority should be given to CODESYS BACnet2 SL . CODESYS BACnet(1) SL still allows for the maintenance of applications created in accordance with protocol revision 14\/15. A migration is possible and is described in the library documentation. See also the documentation displayed in the Library Manager or the BACnet2 Library online help. The installation of the packages contains the following parts: Package: CODESYS BACnet2 SL BACnet plug-in component Device descriptions for BACnet servers, BACnet objects, and BACnet clients Libraries: CmpBACnet , BACnet , BACnetDefaultImpl , CmpBACnet2 , BACnet2 , and BACnetDefaultImpl2 Extensive sample projects BACnet runtime system component For more information see: Library BACnet The following sample projects are available, each in a variant for CODESYS BACnet(1) SL and CODESYS BACnet2 SL : BACnet Server, Backup and Restore BACnet BBMD BACnet Device Discovery BACnet Examples Limiting BACnet Client Object Property Values Persistence for BACnet Objects and Properties BACnet Trend Log (Server) BACnet Routing Building Automation: BACnet Building Automation: Persistence Building Automation: Examples " },

"body" : "CODESYS BACnet2 SL and CODESYS BACnet(1) SL each contain three IEC libraries: CmpBACnet , CmpBACnet2 BACnet , BACnet2 BACnetDefaultImpl , BACnet2DefaultImpl2 (Note: The following descriptions apply to both \"variants\" of a library.) The package also includes the BACnet plug-in for the CODESYS development environment, which performs consistency checks on library versions and BACnet object IDs, as well as providing EDE export\/import. The BACnet stack ( BACstack ) is an optional component of the CODESYS runtimes ( CmpBACnet component). The CmpBACnet IEC library represents the integration of the BACnet stack into a CODESYS IEC environment and provides the BACnet data types as well as the BACstack methods. The sole use of the IEC library CmpBACnet (without the BACnet and BACnetDefaultImpl libraries) would result in complex and lengthy IEC application code. For more information, see: When to Use the BACnet Library or the CmpBACnet Library The BACnet library simplifies BACnet application development considerably as compared to the sole use of CmpBACnet , especially in the following areas: Starting and stopping the BACnet stack Using BACnet server objects and their properties Triggering asynchronous requests (mainly \"client service requests\") and processing the \"request transaction\" Processing of \"callbacks\" from the BACnet stack (see IBACnetEventConsumer ) and distributing the \"callbacks\" to multiple receivers in the application Furthermore, the BACnet library provides a plug-in mechanism ( BACnetServerPlugin ) for extending certain aspects of the BACnet library. BACnetServerPlugin is the basis for the BACnetDefaultImpl library. The BACnetDefaultImpl library is used for the additional simplification of BACnet application development. The BACnet standard ASHRAE 135 leaves some aspects of the practical use of BACnet open. The most notable examples include the following: Persistence of server objects Storage and persistence of Trend Log , Trend Log Multiple , and Event Log entries Update of the date\/time information of the device object CODESYS implementations for these aspects are necessarily based on some assumptions about the PLC and the application, for example: The PLC has a file system. The PLC file system does not have excessively strict limitations regarding data volume, speed, or number of write cycles. Due to these assumptions, such implementations cannot be permanently included in the BACnet library, because this would prevent the implementation of other use cases and the compliance with other constraints. The BACnetDefaultImpl library is the place for these kinds of \"default implementations\". In the best case, if the assumptions are correct, then these standard implementations can be used easily. If the assumptions do not apply, then a standard implementation of a particular aspect can be used very well as an example and a basis for a PLC\/application-specific implementation. For this reason, the BACnetDefaultImpl library is supplied both as a compiled library and as a source code library. " },

"body" : "The descriptions always also apply to the corresponding library of CODESYS BACnet2 SL (\"major revision 2\"). The IEC library BACnet is intended as a layer over the IEC library CmpBACnet . However, the layer does not hide the library because this would require the BACnet library to have \"facade functions\" for functions of CmpBACnet . These \"facade functions\" would result in larger application code and increased runtime requirements. This is difficult for the PLC to accept. For this reason, it is necessary to know when elements from the BACnet library or CmpBACnet library are to be used. General rules: Starting and stopping the BACnet stack Always use BACnetServer.StartBACnetStack and BACnetServer.StopBACnetStack or AutoStart . Never directly use the corresponding functions of the CmpBACnet library, such as CmpBACnet.BACnetServerInit . Using BACnet server objects and their properties Always use the specified function blocks in IEC-lib-BACnet, such as BACnetAnalogValue . Never directly use the corresponding functions of the BACnet library, such as CmpBACnet.BACnetStorePropertyInstance . Triggering of asynchronous requests Always use the specified client function blocks of the BACnet library, such as BACnetClientReadProperty . Never directly use the corresponding functions of the CmpBACnet library, such as CmpBACnet.BACnetReadProperty . All functions of the CmpBACnet library that require a BACnetAsyncTransactionToken belong to this category and should never be used directly. Processing of \"callbacks\" from the BACnet stack and distributing the \"callbacks\" to multiple receivers in the application Always use IBACnetEventConsumer and BACnetServer.RegisterHook \/ UnregisterHook\/RegisterCallback \/ UnregisterCallback . Never directly use the corresponding functions of the CmpBACnet library, such as CmpBACnet.BACnetSetHook or CmpBACnet.BACnetSetCallback . For more information, see: Architecture, Components, and their Tasks When is it appropriate and safe to directly call the functions of the CmpBACnet library? Basically, it is only necessary to call functions of CmpBACnet directly when a corresponding functionality is not provided in the BACnet library. Check the BACnet library first before trying to use CmpBACnet directly. It is possible to use \"blocking functions\" in CmpBACnet , such as BACnet*CbCompletion , BACnetIam(Ex) , or BACnetIHave(Ex), BACnetUnconf* . Most often, you will use BACnet*CbCompletion to implement your specific IBACnetEventConsumer.BACnetEventCallback s. But first check whether or not the BACnetDefaultImpl library already contains an appropriate standard implementation. " },

"body" : "The following instruction guide you to a simple application that uses two BACnet objects in order to 1) write an analog BACnet value at runtime and 2) sound an alarm according to a BACnet notification class when the current BACnet value is outside of a specific range. Requirements: The CODESYS BACnet2 SL package is installed. The runtime supports BACnet . For this to work, the CmpBACnet component has to be entered and configured in the configuration file of the runtime. In CODESYS , create a standard project with a PLC device which supports BACnet . Select the PLC object in the device tree and click Insert Device to insert a BACnet Server . To use BACnet2, add a BACnet2 server. Select the server object and click Insert Device to insert a BACnet_Analog_Value object and a BACnet_Notification_Class object below it. The inserted BACnet objects are displayed in the Devices view. Double-click the BACnet_Analog_Value object to open its configuration editor. On the BACnet Parameter tab, you see the initial configuration of the BACnet Analog Value object. Modify the object properties in the Value column as follows: AckedTransitions : '111 ' NotificationClass : 1 HighLimit : 10 LimitEnable : '11' LowLimit : 0 Now your application provides a BACnet Analog Value and a BACnet Notification Class . Now the configuration is set so that the BACnet Analog Value will generate alarms as soon as its Present_Value property reaches a value outside of [0; 10]. In the PLC_PRG program of your application, define a variable lrVal of type LREAL and insert the following code: Hint: You can also press the F2 key to get the function block instances of the BACnet objects from the Input assistant ( Instance Calls category). BACnet_Analog_Value.PresentValue := BACnet_Analog_Value.PresentValue + 0.0001;\nlrVal := BACnet_Analog_Value.PresentValue; Generate the code ( F11 ), download the error-free application to the controller, and start the application. The BACnet property Present_Value of the BACnet Analog Value object is incremented. Start an external BACnet client (for example, Innea BACnet Explorer Free) that runs at a different network address than the runtime (for example, using a virtual machine). Use it to monitor the values of BACnet property Present_Value and variable lrVal in the BACnet network. You can see how the BACnet property Present_Value is incremented and as a consequence the value of the variable lrVal increases. As soon as Present_Value exceeds the value of 10, an alarm of the type BACnet-NotificationClass inserted in the application is generated on the BACnet server device. This is an example of how you can access the BACnet properties of a BACnet object at runtime. If no explicit property is provided by the BACnet object function block, then at least it provides auxiliary functions for accessing certain or all BACnet properties.

Different root directories can be specified in the configuration file of the runtime. [SysFile]\n; root file path for runtime components\nFilePath=D:\/Temp\/Default\n; root file path for IEC applications\nIecFilePath=D:\/Temp\/IEC When AutoGenerateBACstackConfig is set to TRUE , an IEC application with CODESYS BACnet2 SL writes the configuration file of the BACnet stack (using information from BACnet.BACnetIPdatalink ) when starting the BACnet Server.\nLater during the start routine, code within the runtime system component CmpBACnet reads the configuration file. Therefore, shared read and write access of the IEC application and the runtime component have to be enabled for this configuration file. This is done either by using an absolute path or by using placeholders (for CODESYS Control V3.5.16.0 and higher). Absolute path: ...\n[CmpBACnet2]\nIniFile=D:\/Temp\/bacstac.ini ; Windows\n; Linux -> IniFile=\/tmp\/bacstac.ini\n... Placeholder (example: $BACnet$ ): ...\n[SysFile]\nPlcLogicPrefix=1\nPlaceholderFilePath=, $Firmware$\nPlaceholderFilePath.1=$PlcLogic$\/bacnet, $BACnet$\n\n[CmpBACnet]\nIniFile=$BACnet$\/bacstac.ini\n... Furthermore, CODESYS allows for the \"sandboxing\" of various aspects of the runtime, including access to the file system. In this case, access to the file system within the IEC application and access from the program code of the runtime components are restricted to the configured paths. For more information, see the configuration of SysFile : ...\n[SysFile]\n; ForceFilePath=1\n; ForceIecFilePath=1\n... For more information about this, see the help for CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System, \" CODESYS Control FilePath & Placeholders\". This help is available in the CODESYS GmbH Customer Portal . When configuring the \"sandboxing\" of the file system, you should note that it is possible to access the configuration file of the BACnet stack as described above. Therefore, the alternative using placeholders is required in this case when the path to bacstac.ini is not already configured elsewhere.

"body" : "Each function block of an BACnet object inserted as a device in the project tree is derived from the BACnetStaticObjectBase function block (library BACnet ) and therefore from BACnetObjectBase . BACnetObjectBase provides the capability of changing any BACnet property for any BACnet object function block by means of the general function SetPropertyInstance . The data for the BACnet properties to be set are transferred to SetPropertyInstance in the form of the IEC_BACNET_PROPERTY_CONTENTS structure. Besides an enumeration that describes the data type, this structure also contains a buffer that has a POINTER TO BYTE to the actual BACnet property data. This makes it possible to transfer any BACnet property data structures within the IEC_BACNET_PROPERTY_CONTENTS structure. The specified data type defines the structures or data to which the buffer points. The enumeration CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_DATA_TYPE provides the selection of CODESYS BACnet data types; the corresponding data type is specified in the comment. The basic function block BACnetObjectBase provides auxiliary functions (example: SetBACnetRealProperty , SetBACnetBooleanProperty ) for some of the frequently used data types.

Accordingly, in order to read BACnet properties in the most general case, the BACnetObjectBase function block provides the GetPropertyInstance function. Within the IEC_BACNET_PROPERTY_CONTENTS structure, you can transfer either 1) a buffer pre-initialized with the correct data type, which is then filled, or 2) a buffer of size 0, which is initialized automatically, but which you release again by means of the FreeStackAllocatedMemory function. Regardless of this general case, auxiliary functions are provided for the most frequent cases. Furthermore, for all properties defined in the BACnet standard, there is a selection of function block properties for each BACnet object function block which allows for direct, typed access. " },

Like the objects and the server, each client device also brings with it a function block that is instantiated under the same name as the client device.

The received response is read out into a local variable: PROGRAM PLC_PRG\nVAR\n initDone : BOOL := FALSE;\n readProp : BACnet.BACnetClientReadProperty;\n readPropCnt : INT := 0;\n readPropErrorCnt : INT := 0;\n readPropCancelCnt : INT := 0;\n readPropVal : REAL;\nEND_VAR\n\nIF NOT initDone THEN\n readProp.RegisterToServer(BACnet_Server);\n readProp(\n dwTargetDeviceNumber:= 43,\n objType:= BACnet.CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_OBJECT_TYPE.OBJ_ANALOG_VALUE,\n objInst:= 1,\n propID:= BACnet.CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_PROPERTY_ID.PROP_PRESENT_VALUE,\n nIndex:= -1);\nEND_IF\n\nIF readProp.xExecute AND readProp.xBusy AND readProp.iState = 3 THEN\n IF readPropCnt MOD 2 = 0 THEN \/\/ cancel every second request\n readProp.xAbort := TRUE;\n readPropCancelCnt := readPropCancelCnt + 1;\n END_IF\nEND_IF\nIF NOT readProp.xExecute AND NOT readProp.xAborted AND NOT readProp.xDone THEN\n readProp.xExecute := TRUE;\n readPropCnt := readPropCnt + 1;\nEND_IF\n\nIF readProp.xExecute THEN\n IF readProp.xDone THEN\n readProp.xExecute := FALSE;\n END_IF\n IF readProp.xError THEN\n readProp.xExecute := FALSE;\n readPropErrorCnt := readPropErrorCnt + 1;\n END_IF\n IF readProp.xAborted THEN\n readProp.xExecute := FALSE;\n readProp.xAbort := FALSE;\n END_IF\nEND_IF\n\nreadProp();\n\nIF readProp.xDone OR readProp.xError THEN\n IF readProp.xError THEN\n \/\/ handle error\n ;\n ELSE\n readPropVal := BACnet.GetRealFromContents(readProp.result);\n END_IF\nEND_IF As long as a client-request sends a response, the response contents are provided in the form of one or more output variables, as in the above example. However, this may vary depending on the client action. The example also uses the auxiliary function GetRealFromContents() to read the output variable readProp.result of type IEC_BACNET_PROPERTY_CONTENTS . " },

"body" : "The BACnet library primarily uses BACnet data types (defined in the CmpBACnet library) at their interface (method arguments, method return values, function block properties). If other data types are used on the interface (in this case mainly IEC basic data types), then the corresponding methods and properties perform an implicit conversion to\/from the corresponding internally used BACnet data types. Examples of this: Conversion IEC BOOL <-> CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_BOOLEAN Using BOOL (TRUE\/FALSE) instead of CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_BOOLEAN improves the readability of the IEC code. IEC WSTRING <-> CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_STRING The use of WSTRING is necessary because a conversion to\/from the internally used BACnet data types CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_STRING_TYPE.BACNET_STRING_UTF_8 or CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_STRING_TYPE.BACNET_STRING_ISO_8859_1 is performed. IEC DATE \/ TIME \/ BACnetDateTime <-> CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_DATE\/CmpBACnet.IEC_BACNET_TIME The use of DATE \/ TIME is more common for the IEC programmer and therefore it is preferred on the interface. At the interface of the BACnet library, BACnet data types other than the BACnet data types are used only in well-founded exceptions in order to simplify the application IEC code. The additional effort for a conversion, which is generally small, is negligible. " },
