If the \"<device name> Parameters\" tab is not displayed, then select the Show generic device configuration views option in the CODESYS options, in the Device editor category. With the KNX editor from CODESYS , you define the communication objects of your building automation. The communication objects are exported and made available to the ETS5 program. Linking the communication objects to the different KNX devices is performed exclusively in the ETS5 program. Therefore, only the objects are generated in CODESYS . The objects are linked to variables from the PLC program by means of I\/O Mapping . You add an Ethernet adapter below the controller. Then you add the KNX device below the adapter. You can insert only one KNX device per controller. For more information about the device editor, see: Dialog: Options – Device editor . " },

Parameterize the objects in ETS5. Start the program on the controller. Transfer the KNX configuration to the controller. The checksum is also transferred. The runtime system checks whether or not both checksums match. When they match, the KNX device is identified as functional by the green arrow. If not, then an error is issued in the logger.

The signal can be used to identify a special controller when several controllers are used (for example, by switching a LED). The status is also set when the Program Button is set to TRUE . Then the device is in programming mode. As soon as ETS5 has successfully set the physical address, this input switches to FALSE . Program Button The Program Button is needed for assigning the physical address from ETS5. If the output is set to TRUE , then the device is in programming mode and then ETS5 can assign the address specified there to the device.

If it is set to TRUE, then cyclic sending or send on change is stopped. If none of the send on difference , send on change , or Cyclic sending options is selected, then sending is triggered by a rising edge.

Project title In CODESYS , these parameters can be defined in the project information. They are imported to ETS5 in the XML file and displayed here. Identifier : Checksum of the configuration The checksum is also displayed in CODESYS and has to be identical to the checksum displayed here so that communication can be started. Application date Identifier Version Application state Description The objects are subdivided into groups of ten: 1–10, 11–20, 21–30, etc. A maximum of 1000 communication objects is possible. Object 1–10 <type> Type of the object The parameter cannot be changed. Communication direction Output (PLC to KNX) : The value is sent from the CODESYS controller to the KNX object. For this communication direction, more settings are possible ( Send condition , etc.) Input (KNX to PLC) : The value is sent to the CODESYS controller. The parameter cannot be changed. Send condition no automatic sending : No sending when value is changed send on change : Sending each time value is changed send on difference : Sending when the change in value corresponds to at least the value for Sending difference Sending difference Requirement: Send condition is send on difference . The value is passed when its change is at least this value. Cyclic sending disable : No cyclic sending enable (seconds) , Enable (minutes) : Cyclic sending – regardless of the Send condition Cycle time [hh:mm:ss] Rate for cyclic sending (in hours\/minutes\/seconds) Requirement: Cyclic sending is set to Enable (seconds) .
