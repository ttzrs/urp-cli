"body" : "The fundamentals for applications which are based on the UADP protocol is the consistent transport of a data structure via UADP (i.e., OPC-coded frames via UDP\/IP). Because consistency must be maintained, the data structure must fit into a UDP frame (1500 bytes). And because space is limited, transmission via UADP must be as efficient as possible. Only RawData Field Encoding is supported. (This saves space.) Only DataSetMessages of type Data Key Frame are supported. (Cyclical exchange of real-time data) The structure – i.e., the sequence of values ( DataSetField ) and their types ( DataSetMessage ) – remains unchanged during operation and is agreed upon in advance between the publisher and the subscriber. (No metadata needs to be transferred during operation.) The following table will help you to understand the parameters used: The GroupVersion parameter is used by the Subscriber to check whether the received structure corresponds to the expected structure. A subscriber can use the SequenceNumber parameter to recognize whether messages have been lost. The DataSetMessages parameters are structured as follows. The data structures of the publisher are coded 1:1 from IEC to OPC UA. The parameters used are explained in the following table. The DataSetMessage parameter, which consists of the DataSetMessage header and the individual DataSetFields data (= Data Key Frame ), is inserted after the NetworkMessage header. A DataSetField consists of a value of a basic data type: Part 14 of the OPC UA specification states: The FieldCount parameter must be omitted if the RwaData Field Encoding option is set in the EncodingFlags flags of the DataSetMessage header ( DataSetFlags1 ). The FieldCount is therefore not encoded in the \"Data Key Frame\". This means that 1500 bytes - 15 bytes = 1485 bytes of user data are still available for the transport of a data structure via UADP. Part 14 of the OPC UA specification states: The FieldCount is ignored if the RawDate Encodings are set in the EncodingFlags of the DataSetMessage header ( DataSetFalgs1 ). The FieldCount is therefore not encoded in the data key frame. This means that 1500 bytes - 15 bytes = 1485 bytes of user data are still available for the transport of a data structure via UADP.

"body" : "The OPC UA Binary Data Encoding is a data format which has been developed to meet the performance demands of OPC UA applications. This format is primarily designed for fast encoding and decoding, whereby the size of the encoded data on the line has also been taken into account. OPC UA binary data encoding is based on several primitive data types with clearly defined encoding rules that can be sequentially written to or read from a binary stream. A structure is encoded by sequentially writing the encoded form of each field. If a particular field is also a structure, then the values of its fields are written sequentially before the next field is written to the containing structure. All fields must be written to the data stream, even if they contain zero values. The encodings for each primitive type indicate how to encode either a zero value or a default value for the type. The OPC UA binary data encoding does not contain any type or field name information because all OPC UA applications are expected to know in advance which services and structures they support.
