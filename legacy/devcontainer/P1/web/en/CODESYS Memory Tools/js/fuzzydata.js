"body" : "When the CODESYS Memory Tools package is installed, CODESYS can display a core dump from the PLC in online mode. In the Memory view, you configure the application and memory area to be displayed. You can also perform CODESYS -defined consistency checks of the memory and print the result to the message view. Example The following core dump (a sample from a CODESYS Control Win ) shows the hexadecimal addresses of the memory on the left. The data is shown in hexadecimal notation in the middle and as text on the right. Any data that cannot be represented by a displayable character is shown as a dot ( . ). 0x04D7789C: 0000 301E 1C2C DE04 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ..0..,Þ.............\n0x04D778B0: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ....................\n0x04D778C4: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 .................... The displayed bytes in the memory dump can be overwritten and the changes written to the PLC. CODESYS does not check that the changes are permitted. You can crash the application if you make careless changes. You can define the absolute start address of the core dump, for example by specifying the address value from a pointer variable. You also have the option of specifying the start address relative to the memory area of the PLC by defining the range and an offset. In the memory display, you can browse the adjacent memory segments or save the core dump to a file. You can overwrite the data in hexadecimal notation and transfer the changes to the PLC. The commands for this are provided in the toolbar. For example, when you step into the application when error checking, CODESYS continuously refreshes the view of the core dump. When you set the cursor in the hexadecimal data, you can right-click to copy the address of this data to the clipboard ( Copy Address command). " },
