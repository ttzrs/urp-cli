You can use the Class Diagram to design and display the object-oriented structure of the project. Every update to the project is immediately applied to the diagram. The project and the diagram are consistent. The Statechart represents the states of a state machine with the triggering transitions. With this graphical implementation language, you can model object-oriented POUs and implement them directly. A license is not required to display class diagrams and statecharts. You can download the  CODESYS UML  add-on from the CODESYS Store International or the  CODESYS Store North America . There you will also find the data sheet for the product.

"body" : "UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a graphical language for the specification, design, and documentation of object-oriented software. It provides a universally understandable basis for discussion between programming and other departments within system development. The Unified Modeling Language in itself defines 14 different diagram types from two main categories: structure diagrams and behavior diagrams. Structure diagrams schematically represent the architecture of the software and are used primarily for modeling and analysis (for example, project design, specification of system requirements, and documentation). Behavior diagrams are executable models with unique syntax and semantics from which application code can be generated directly (model driven architecture). CODESYS UML extends the CODESYS Development System by two UML languages: UML Class Diagram (type: structure diagram) : UML Statechart (type: behavior diagram) If a valid license for CODESYS UML does not exist on your computer, then you can still compile a project with UML POUs, download it to the controller, and use it in online mode. Editing the POUs in the respective editor is possible with a valid license only. After the standard installation of CODESYS UML , you will find a descriptive sample project in the installation directory under Projects\\UML\\< CODESYS version>\\Examples . Example: C:\\Program Files\\ CODESYS \\3.5.13.20\\ CODESYS \\Projects\\UML\\4.1.0.0\\Examples\\UML\\_SC\\_CoffeeMachine.project " },

"body" : "A statechart is a graphical formalism with which you can graphically program a finite state machine. A state machine is a system that is continuously in one of a finite number of states at runtime. Actions can be executed in each state. When an event occurs, a transition to the next state takes place. Actions can also be performed during the transition. In CODESYS , a statechart is a POU that is created in the Statechart implementation language. This type of POU is identified by the symbol in the POUs view or Devices view. You can create programs, function blocks, functions, methods, actions, or properties as statecharts. The editor provides elements for states, pseudo states, and transitions. States as well as transitions can call methods or actions. Pseudo states are control elements used to control the process, but they do not call any actions or methods. States: : State : Fast state : Composite state Pseudo states: : Start state : End state : Fork\/Join : Choice Transitions: : Transition : Completion transition : Exception transition A statechart has at least two states and two transitions to switch to the other state. The guard condition of a transition that responds to an event is a Boolean expression or Boolean variable. It is displayed in regular font and in square brackets next to the transition line. Example below: [bPowerOn] , [bPowerOff] , [bDoIt] , [bReady] . A transaction action is an action to be executed as soon as the guard condition of the transition is TRUE . The action name is displayed in bold font with \/\/ before the transition line. Example below: \/\/PowerUp \/\/PowerDown TODO Transitions have priorities that apply when the guard conditions of multiple outgoing transitions of the active state apply simultaneously. In this case, the priorities are represented in the diagram by a numeric symbol at the beginning of the transition line. See example below at the state Idle : (1) and (2). States can have a total of three types of actions: ENTRY , DO , and EXIT . For details about these actions, see the help page for the State element. Example The example shows the statechart for a simple machine with the usual three states: PowerOff , Idle , and DoIt . When an event occurs, which means that the created guard condition is fulfilled, the system switches to the next state. For example, the machine switches to the working status DoIt as soon as the guard condition bDoIt gets the value TRUE . When all actions are ended, the machine switches back to the state Idle to wait for the next event. The machine can also be switched off ( \/\/PowerDown action) and is then in the PowerOff state.

However, you can configure a state in such a way that it is executed in-cycle and the state quickly executes all actions within one bus cycle. This kind of state is displayed in red in the implementation. In the case of functions and methods, the local variables are usually temporary. At runtime, the local variables are not stored, but released, when the POU is exited. As a result, the information about the state of the statechart is not stored. Therefore, a switching behavior controlled by the bus cycle is not possible. For this reason, statecharts in functions or methods are executed in-cycle. So if you implement a method as a statechart, then this diagram is switched quickly. Also in the ToolBox view, only a red state is available. You can prevent this behavior by declaring instance variables VAR_INST instead of local variables in the function or method. When you exit the method, instance variables are stored in the calling POU (a program or a function block instance). The state transitions are then switched slowly edge-controlled with the bus cycle.

"body" : "Drafting and implementing a statechart A statechart is a machine that switches from state to state at runtime. The states are linked by transitions, which each have a guard condition. Actions or methods can be called both in states and in transitions. When a guard condition gets the value TRUE (event), the transition will be activated. This executes the actions or methods that belong to the transition and then switches to the next state. Guard conditions are simply Boolean variables that reflect events or are an expression. Events are user input of a visualization\/user interface, I\/Os, time events, or system events. Another event that is often required is the completion event which occurs when the actions or methods of a state are completed. You insert all required states in the statechart editor and implement the flow control. To do this, you code the guard conditions for the transitions by specifying a Boolean variable or an ST expression. You implement the actual functionality of the statechart in the actions and methods that are called in the states or during the transitions. Therefore, the methods and actions assigned to a statechart contain the algorithms. This is how you implement the object-oriented class concept in the conventional way. During the software design phase, you can already use the statechart editor as a design tool. For example, you can create a graphics file ( BMP ) from a statechart in order to add it to a specification or a design document. Identify all the states that the machine will have. Identify the possible state transitions from one state to another. Identify the events that occur during the runtime of the machine and that trigger a state transition. Group the relevant events chronologically. Identify the ENTRY , DO , and EXIT actions or methods to call during a state. Identify actions or methods to call during transitions.

"body" : "Exception transition An exception transition controls the switch to the next state or pseudo state if an error or an exception occurs. The exception transition has a guard condition and optionally an action. An exception transition interrupts the current processing. First, the currently active state is processed until the end of the cycle. Then the system switches to the state which is intended as a reaction to this exception. In this state, error handling and exception handling are executed. The source state is usually a composite, orthogonal state. The exception transition is used to exit a composite state from any substate. Its state is evaluated after the DO action for the active state has been executed. Even when the condition for the exception transition is TRUE the first time a composite state is entered, the DO action of the first state is executed. Because the ENTRY and EXIT actions are not linked to conditions, they are always executed regardless of the exception transition. You can interpret an exception transition insofar that it does not originate from a composite state, but directly from each substate. The conditions for the exception transitions are evaluated after their DO actions. Because the ENTRY and EXIT actions are not linked to conditions, they are always executed regardless of the exception transition. " },
