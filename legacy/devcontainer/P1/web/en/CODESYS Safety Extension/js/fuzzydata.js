Access protection of the safety controller Access protection of the safety controller is established with the following mechanisms: User management in the project Administration password Telepassword Identification of the safety controller User management in the project Each part of a safety application of a CODESYS project can be protected against unauthorized access by means of appropriate settings in the CODESYS user management. In order to guarantee the access protection of the safety application, the user must set up a corresponding CODESYS user management (see Protecting and Saving Projects ) or use the user configuration integrated in CODESYS Safety Extension (see Setting Up User Management in the Project). Administration password (boot application password) The boot application can be protected against unauthorized write access by means of the administrator password (admin password) (see Set admin password). Commands that are protected by the administration password: Login Create Boot Application Delete boot application Restart boot application Set admin password Update firmware Configure teleaccess Reset cold STOP START Write Values Force Values Unforce Values Change device name Telepassword The telepassword protects the safety controller against unauthorized teleaccess. For more information, see: Area 'Access to device' ). Commands that are possible for teleaccess: Login Logout Refresh ; button in the Safety Online Information tab of the safety controller Show and save log; buttons in the Log tab of the safety controller Identification of the safety controller (IEC 62443 Level 1) The following measure from Security Level 1 of IEC 62443 is implemented: Measure to avoid logging in to the wrong controller: Entry of the serial number of the safety controller Pressing a button (or switch) on the safety controller To successfully log in to the safety controller, one of these two actions must be carried out, depending on the safety controller (see Connection confirmation ). These measures can be classified as relatively safe because pressing a button must be done manually and directly on the safety controller and the entry of the serial number requires insider knowledge of the machine.

"body" : "Check possibilities for accessing the controller. Controllers must not under any circumstances be accessible from the Internet or untrustworthy networks. In particular, the programming ports of the controller must not under no circumstances be accessible from the Internet without protection (usually UDP ports 1740 to 1743 and TCP ports 1217 + 11740 or the controller-specific ports). If access from the Internet needs to be permitted, then it is imperative that there is a secure method of connecting to the controller (example: VPN). In order to minimize the risk of data security violations, we recommend the following organizational and technical actions for the system where your applications are running: As far as possible, avoid exposing the PLC and control networks to open networks and the Internet. For protection, use additional data link layers, such as a VPN for teleaccess and install firewall mechanisms. Restrict access to authorized persons, change existing standard passwords during the initial commissioning, and continue to change them regularly. If you want to publish your web visualization despite all warnings, then it is urgently recommended that at least you provide it with simple password protection in order to prevent someone from accessing your controller functionality over the Internet.

"body" : "In CODESYS Safety Extension , a safety user configuration is integrated for a project with safety application. The project manager can use this safety user configuration for his project or create his own user management. The project manager must already decide at the beginning of the creation of the new project in the New project dialog whether he would like to create an Empty project without user configuration or an Empty Safety project with safety user configuration (see Setting Up the Safety Application ). If an Empty project is created (i.e., a project without safety user configuration), then the project manager must create a user management for the safety project himself (see User Management, Rights Assignment in CODESYS Help). The permissions assignment for the user management is located in the Project menu ( User Management and then Permissions ). Every user belongs automatically to the Everyone group. Settings the safety user configuration This user management already contains the following settings: User groups Owner Safety Safety.ExtendedLevel Everyone Users Owner belongs to the Owner group saf belongs to the Safety group ext belongs to the Safety.ExtendedLevel and Safety groups. The preset users do not have a password yet. The Owner group already includes the Owner users, but still without a password. The Owner user can assign corresponding users to the \"Safety\", \"Safety.ExtendedLevel\", and \"Owner\" user groups in the menu Project → Project settings → Users and groups , and issue passwords to the users. The Owner user can define new user groups. A new user group initially has the permissions of the Everyone user group of the Safety User Configuration. Through the assignment of a new group to other, already existing user groups (e.g. Safety , Safety.ExtendedLevel ), the new group receives the access rights of the group to which it is assigned. The project manager must issue a suitable, safe password to the \"Owner\" user, in order to ensure the access protection of the project. Password definition Open the Project menu. Click Project Settings . In the Project Settings dialog, select the Users and Groups tab. On the Users tab, select the Owner entry. Click the Edit button. In the Edit User dialog, enter the old password, the new password, and the password confirmation. Click the OK button. For more information about assigning passwords, see: User Management and Password Manager in the CODESYS Help The permissions to commands, users and groups, object types and project objects are specified as follows in the user management, but can be changed at any time by members of the Owner group. Rights assignment of the Safety User Configuration The Owner group has all permissions.

"body" : "The logical I\/Os serve the exchange of data between the standard and safety controllers. Two types of data can be exchanged: global variables and I\/O data. The safety controller itself has no I\/O data. These must be configured in the standard controller and then exchanged with the safety controller as logical I\/Os. If an I\/O module with safe I\/Os is inserted in the controller configuration in CODESYS , then a matching logical I\/O is automatically inserted in the safety controller (same name as the I\/O module on the standard side). This logical I\/O contains all safe I\/O channels as well as the safety parameters of the module, so that all safety-relevant information can be found under the safety application. Types of logical I\/Os Logical I\/O of a Safe Physical Device Logical I\/O of a Standard Field Device Logical I\/O for Data Exchange with the Standard Controller ( logical exchange devices ) The logical I\/Os of the safety application are linked to the default application with physical devices or Logical Exchange GVLs (special object on standard side). This means that there is precisely one logical I\/O in the safety application for each physical device whose input\/output signals are processed in the safety application. Likewise, precisely one logical I\/O exists under the safety application for each GVL for the logical exchange of the standard controller. The assignment is variable. The fail-safe parameters of a device whose inputs\/outputs are processed in the safety application can be edited only in the appropriate logical I\/O in the safety application. The descriptions of the logical I\/Os are managed in the Logical devices category of the Device Repository. For a better overview, folders can be added to the project tree under Logical I\/O in order to group the logical I\/Os. " },

"body" : "The logical I\/Os are assigned depending on the name of the application and the logical I\/O object. This gives rise to the following notes: If the name of a logical I\/O is changed, then the name of the physical device or the Logical Exchange GVL must be automatically tracked so that it does not have to be reassigned to the logical I\/O. The renaming (except in the case of \"default assignment\") or relocation of field devices in the device tree or of Logical Exchange GVLs in the main application does not change the assignment to the logical I\/O in any way. The safety application is changed automatically when it is renamed: The assigned logical I\/O is renamed the same as the field device. If the field device is shifted into a different parallel controller, then the link is dissolved and the field device must be reassigned to the logical I\/O of the safety application. The deletion of the field device from the device tree or of the Logical Exchange GVL from the default application means that the assigned logical I\/O can no longer be mapped to anything (no longer supplied). The deletion of the logical I\/O object means that fail-safe settings are no longer mapped to the field device or that the \"from Safety\" variables in the Logical Exchange GVL are no longer supplied. If a different logical I\/O object is given the old name of a renamed or deleted logical I\/O object, then from now on its settings are mapped to the assigned field device or its variable values are exchanged with the Logical Exchange GVL. The assignment is thus indirectly changed. If a logical I\/O has been deleted and a new logical I\/O is inserted with the name of the deleted logical I\/O, then the assignment is active again. If a physical I\/O object that is linked with a logical I\/O object is copied, then the logical I\/O object is also copied together with its data. " },

If safety user management is set up, this parameterization can only be done by members of the Safety user group. Changed assignments of physical field devices and Logical Exchange GVLs do not change the safety application, since the changes of assignments take place under the main application (standard application) and become effective by downloading to the standard controller. A pre-verified and accepted CODESYS Safety Extension safety application can be detached from the original project and integrated completely in a different project without this new safety application having to be verified again.

Any number of POUs can be added to the project tree of the safety application. For a better overview, you can create folders below the application in the project tree, and then add POUs and GVLs to these folders. Characteristics of the program and the function block: Program A program cannot be called by other programs, but it can call function block instances. Programs are called directly by the safety task. The programs that are called are defined in the Safety Task object. Only the called programs are executed on the controller. Function block Function blocks are always called by means of an instance, which is a copy of the function block that contains the data. Each instance has an identifier (instance name) and a data structure which contains its input, output, and internal variables. Function block instances can be called in function blocks. As function blocks are declared and used like in CODESYS standard, they will not be described here any further. Object properties of a POU Every POU of a safety application has a properties dialog. This dialog is opened by selecting the corresponding POU in the project tree and activating the context menu command Properties . It contains the following tabs: Common Safety Access Control CRC of an object Contrary to the pin CRC, the CRC for the individual objects of the safety application identifies the object contents together with the object version. The CRC is of importance if individual objects of a safety application are reused in another application. Tab: Safety Safety CRC CRC of this POU Version (editable) The developer can freely assign the version. The version can be used for quickly detecting the object version in the Tab: Objects (object list) of the safety application object. Comment (editable) Usage The Single call option is automatically selected in the case of POU type PROGRAM . The setting cannot be changed. can be selected in the case of POU type FUNCTION_BLOCK and can be enabled or disabled.

The Safety FBD editor is functionally based on the FBD editor of CODESYS V3 and is extended by safety specific functions. The use of the Safety FBD Editor corresponds to that of the CODESYS V3 FBD Editor . General editing commands ( Copy , Paste , Cut , Delete , Undo , Find\/Replace ) and the commands of the Safety FBD category are available to the user. The Cut , Copy , and Paste commands can only be executed between safety objects (POU), not between safety and standard objects (POU). The general Delete editing command deletes an element from the FBD network. What is deleted depends on the cursor position where the command is executed. If an input or output of a box which represents a function block call is deleted, then the elements at the input or output are also deleted. If the main output of a FB call located within a network is deleted, then the entire tree to the left of this box output will be removed (i.e. including the block itself). If the box is the (right-hand) end of a network, then the last output (main output) can also be removed. The block is then retained and has no outputs.

"body" : "Login – Safety Shortcut: Alt + F8 Function : This command connects the programming system, i.e. the safety application, with the safety controller and thus establishes the online mode. Call : Online menu The developer can only log in to the application (boot application) on the controller from the project if the application in the project and the application on the controller match. Therefore, a comparison between the application in the project and the application running on the safety controller takes place before the execution of a login operation: The state of the safety controller after the login operation depends on this. If the application in the project and the application on the controller match, then the command logs the user in to the application (boot application) on the controller. For a confirmed connection and teleaccess: If the current application and the application on the safety controller are identical and have the same Pin, a message appears informing you that the login is taking place to a pinned application. The safety controller is in safe mode. The application is in online mode. If for a confirmed connection and teleaccess the current application and the application on the safety controller are identical but not pinned, then the login takes place without a dialog. The safety controller is in safe mode. The application is in online mode. If no application exists on the controller, or another application or a different application status exists on the controller than in the project, then no login is possible for teleaccess. When the connection is confirmed, the Download safety application to controller dialog opens. If there is no application on the controller, the developer will be asked in a dialog whether the application is to be loaded to the safety controller. If the two applications have different names (i.e. a different application is running on the safety controller), then a dialog asks whether the application on the safety controller should be terminated and the current application loaded to the safety controller. If the current application has been changed, a dialog asks whether the application on the safety controller should be terminated and the current application loaded to the safety controller. If the application currently running on the safety controller is ended by this action, then the safe operating mode of the controller is also ended and the outputs of the safety controller immediately enter the safe state. This typically causes a hard stop of the machine. By downloading the new application, the safety controller enters an unsafe operating mode (debug mode). Before confirming the dialog, actions must be taken to guarantee organizational safety and the corresponding instructions in the Safety User Manual must be read. At the end of the download, the safety controller is in debug mode. The application is in online mode. In the dialog, you select whether the active application is to be temporarily downloaded to the controller or whether a boot application should be created and stored on the controller. For more information about creating the boot application, see the description of the Create Boot Application command. For downloading the active application (temporary or as a new boot application) The active application has to compile without errors. (It is compiled automatically before login when the current application project since opening or since its last change has not been compiled yet.) The communication of the device has to be configured correctly. The connection to the confirmed controller has to be done. The network connection has to be established and confirmed or authorized.

"body" : "Pinning means that a reference point to the current version of a safety application is set that identifies the specific version of the safety application and the associated objects. By means of the pin it is possible to identify a certain version of the application in the project, of an object in the editor and of a boot application on the safety controller. In addition, the verifier, on the basis of the pin, can recognize at any time changes in the application structure, in the contents of its objects, and in the library function blocks referred to. A specific version is made identifiable by setting a pin. However, no copy of the specific version is generated when doing this. The pin functions can be found in the editor of the application object. To do this, the safety application object is selected in the project tree and opened by means of the Edit Object context menu command. The Objects tab shows the compare view, which displays the version and the CRC of the objects of the current project and of the pinned project. For a detailed description of the information and the application list see: Tab: Objects (object list)) Commands for the pin function For the command to pin the safety application, see: Pin projectFor the command to clear the pin, see: Clear pinThe pinned version of the safety application comprises the following: Scope of the safety application: Which safety objects belong to the application Which library function blocks the application requires Execution-relevant version of the objects and library function blocks in the scope of the application: Code of each object of the application Configuration and device parameter of each logical I\/O object of the application Interface of the external implementation of each library function block used Version designations of the objects The execution-relevant version does not include the object comments. These are not pinned and therefore can be updated at the end and during the verification. The verifier identifies a pinned version by a pin identifier, which is displayed at different points in the development system. The pin identifier contains the following information: Name Revision counter, which is incremented by one when pinning. CRC: A CRC32 of the pinned execution version In addition, the time of pinning is recorded. However, this is not part of the pin identifier. " },

The download application no longer exists on the controller after logging out. Boot application : A boot application is created from the download application in online mode and stored on the safety controller. It remains on the controller after logging out and starts after restarting the safety controller. Confirmed Connection : A confirmed connection is required for every online functionality on site between CODESYS Safety Extension and a safety controller. With the connection confirmation, the user confirms that the network connection has connected him with the correct controller. A confirmed connection is possible in safe mode and debug mode. Connection for teleaccess : Teleaccess is used for PLC diagnosis and it is possible in safe mode only. The following functionalities are available during teleaccess: Show and save log Display PLC details and firmware details Login for equality to the project (no download) Monitoring The developer is responsible for ensuring the safety of the plant\/machine over the entire time period in which the safety controller is in debug mode (e.g. by cordoning off the machine (organizational measure). In order for the CODESYS online functions and input assistance to work for the safety application, they must fulfill the standard compiler version as well as the safety language subset. If a later compiler version is used in the project, then additional limitations may result for the safety application. For example, there may be new keywords that can no longer be used as identifiers. You detect a violation of such additional limitations when you log in for the first time, not with the Build → Build command. A corresponding message appears and login is not possible.

This is necessary to provide the current values to the physical devices, the Logical Exchange GVLs of the main controller, and the logical I\/Os of the safety controller. Substitute values In contrast to the information in this section, this implementation demonstrates the following behavior: If the default controller is stopped, then the values of the default controller are transmitted. If the safety application is stopped while the standard application is running, then the physical I\/Os do not receive any current values of the safety application. If the standard application is stopped while the safety application is running, then the logical I\/Os do not receive any current values of the main controller. In these cases, substitute values are applied. Substitute values for I\/Os If the developer stops the safety application, then all output channels (digital and analog, safe and unsafe) are automatically set to zero, and in the case of safe field devices, they are marked as failsafe values when the safety protocol supports this. If the developer stops the safety application, then valid data continue to be copied from input channels to the mapped variables. If I\/O communication is stopped due to a mismatch while the application is running, then the input channels of safe field devices are set to failsafe values according to protocol and marked in the protocol API as failsafe. If I\/O communication is stopped due to a mismatch while the application is running, then the input channels of unsafe field devices are set to zero. If the application is terminated (e.g., by downloading a new application), then a final output image is generated with all output channels (digital and analog) of safe field devices being set to failsafe values according to protocol and marked in the protocol as failsafe. If the application is terminated (e.g., by downloading a new application), then a final output image is generated with all output channels (digital and analog) of unsafe field devices being set to zero. If none of the current values can be exchanged as long as the application has not been terminated, then the following applies to the variable exchange: Substitute values for exchange variables If the developer stops the safety application, or if the application of the standard controller is not running, then: Zero values are written to the mapped read variables (exchange variables) of the other application. Except in the case of an exchange mismatch, the values of the other application (variable ...Out ) continue to be copied to the application's own variables (variable ...In ). If the variable exchange is stopped due to a mismatch, then zero values are written to the safety application on the mapped read variables (logical exchange object ...In ).

"body" : "Generic state chart of safety FBs Explanation of the generic state chart: It provides a general overview of the states and transitions. Some transitions are not named, which means that they are FB-specific and must be assigned with the respective FB. The diagram shows three areas: In the top area, the function block is not active and in the safe state (safe outputs are FALSE ). In the middle area, the function block is active and in the safe state (safe outputs are FALSE ). In the bottom area, the function block is in the normal state (safe outputs are TRUE ). The first horizontal line in the status diagram shows the transition from an inactive FB to an active FB. The second horizontal line shows the transition from a unsafe state to a safe state. The priorities of possible parallel transitions are given by numbers (highest priority 0 ). The states contain the state name and the hexadecimal diagnostic code. The conditions OR , AND , and XOR are used as logical operators and NOT as negation. In the FB description, the start state is Idle , with the transitions to the individual operating states via the Init state. Activate = FALSE switches from each state directly to the Idle state ( 0 = highest priority is reserved for Activate = FALSE ). For improved overview, these transitions are not shown in each status diagram. This is mentioned as a footnote in each status diagram. Dur to the overview, the setting of outputs is not defined in the state chart. An explicit truth table, which includes the information \"FB states to output (outputs) \", is part of each FB specification with the FB-specific error and stats codes. FB-specific error codes DiagCode Status Name Status description and output setting Cxxx Error Ready = TRUE S_Out = FALSE Error = TRUE FB-specific status codes (no error) DiagCode Status Name Status description and output setting 0000 Idle Ready = FALSE S_Out = FALSE Error = FALSE 8001 Init state of the operating mode Ready = TRUE S_Out = FALSE Error = FALSE 8xxx All states of the operating mode where S_Out = FALSE Ready = TRUE S_Out = FALSE Error = FALSE 8000 All states of the operating mode where S_Out = TRUE Ready = TRUE S_Out = TRUE Error = FALSE " },

"body" : "Identification of the library described here: SafetyPLCopen, 1.1.1.0 (system) Basis: PLCopen TC5: Safety Software, Part 1: Concepts and Function Blocks , Version 1.0, Jan. 2006 The PLCopen function blocks (prefixed with SF_ ) have been defined by the PLCopen organization together with its members and external organizations dealing with safety-oriented aspects. These function blocks are certified and as a result reduce the time and costs in the development, verification, and acceptance of a safety application. Similar to a logical wiring, the blocks can be linked to each other by logical operations. Thus, important components of a safety application can be created quickly and without much programming effort. For information describing the individual PLCopen FBs in more detail, see the PLCopen \"Technical Committee 5 – Safety Software\" specification version which is current at the time of certification. PLCopen FBs can be used only in programs and function blocks where Single call is set (see: FB calls ).

"body" : "This function block block selects the system operation mode, such as manual, automatic, semi-automatic, etc. When starting the controller, it should be assumed that the machine is in a safe mode. When starting the machine, the transition to the mode set by the mode selector must be initiated by a device input (e.g. START button of the machine). The activation of the FB following the default state is the ModeChanged state. This is also the safe state of the FB, where all S_ModeXSel and S_AnyModeSel are FALSE . When the FB is in the ModeChanged state: The new S_ModeX input must be confirmed with a rising S_SetMode trigger edge (in case AutoSetMode = FALSE ), which leads to a new S_ModeXSel output. The new S_ModeX input automatically leads to an S_ModeXSel output (in case AutoSetMode = TRUE ). Such a transition from state 8005 to 8000 is valid only if one S_ModeX input is TRUE . As long as all S_ModeX are FALSE, the FB remains in state 8005 , even if S_SetMode triggers. The transition from ModeChanged to ModeSelected state, that is S_SetMode is set by the operator, is not monitored by a timer. When the FB is in the ModeSelected state, the simultaneous occurrence of a new S_ModeX input (higher priority) and the NOT S_Unlock signal (lower priority) leads to the ModeChanged state. The S_ModeX input parameters which are not used for mode selection should be assigned the default value FALSE to simplify the verification of the program. The AutoSetMode input should be activated only if it is guaranteed that no hazard can occur when the S-PLC is started. " },

"body" : "This function block requires two inputs which map the position of the safety guard with two switches: a discrepancy time input and a Reset input. If the safety guard has only one switch, then the S_GuardSwitch1 and S_GuardSwitch2 inputs can be bridged. The watchdog time is the maximum time within which the two switches must be closed for the safety guard to close. The Reset , S_StartReset and S_AutoReset inputs define how the function block is reset after the safety guard has been opened. When the safety guard is opened, the two inputs S_GuardSwitch1 and S_GuardSwitch2 should switch to FALSE . The S_GuardMonitoring output switches to FALSE as soon as one of the two inputs S_GuardSwitch1 or S_GuardSwitch2 is set to FALSE . To close the safety guard, both inputs S_GuardSwitch1 and S_GuardSwitch2 have to switch to TRUE . SF_GuardMonitoring monitors the symmetry of the switching process. The S_GuardMonitoring output remains FALSE if only one of the contacts has completed the open\/close process. The behavior of the S_GuardMonitoring output depends on the time difference of both switching inputs. The discrepancy time is monitored as soon as the value of the two inputs S_GuardSwitch1\/S_GuardSwitch2 differs. If the discrepancy time has been exceeded but both inputs still differ, then the S_GuardMonitoring output remains FALSE . If the second respective S_GuardSwitch1\/S_GuardSwitch2 input switches to TRUE within the discrepancy time, then the S_GuardMonitoring output is set to TRUE , with subsequent confirmation.

"body" : "Muting is the deliberate suppression of a safety function. This is necessary, for example, when material is to be transported into the hazardous area without causing the machine to stop. Muting is triggered by a muting sensor. The use of two or four muting sensors and the correct integration into the production process has to ensure that no person enters the hazardous area while the light grid is muted. Muting sensors can be proximity switches, photoelectronic barriers, limit switches, etc. which do not have to be fail-safe. Active muting mode has to be indicated by indicator lamps. There are sequential and parallel muting methods. Sequential muting with four muting sensors is used in this block. An execution of the forward direction of transport is listed below. The FB can be used in both directions: forward and backward. Muting should be activated by the MutingEnable signal from the process to prevent tampering. If the MutingEnable signal is not available, then the input has to be set to TRUE. The input parameters of the function block include the signals of the four muting sensors ( MutingSwitch11 , MutingSwitch12 , MutingSwitch21 , and MutingSwitch22 ), as well as the OSSD signal of the \"active opto-electronic protective device\" S_AOPD_In . The S_StartReset input shall only be activated if it is ensured that no hazardous situation can occur when the S-PLC is started. Example of SF_MutingSeq in forward direction with four sensors No. Image Explanation 1 If the muting sensor MutingSwitch12 ( MS_12 ) is actuated by a workpiece after MutingSwitch11 (MS12 ), then the muting mode is activated. 2 Muting mode remains active as long as MutingSwitch11 (MS11 ) and MutingSwitch12 (MS_12 ) are actuated by the workpiece. The workpiece can pass through the light grid without causing a machine stop. 3 Before the muting sensors MutingSwitch11 ( MS_11 ) and MutingSwitch12 ( MS_12 ) are deactivated, MutingSwitch21 ( MS_21 ) and MutingSwitch22 ( MS_22 ) have to be activated. This ensures that the muting mode remains active. 4 Muting mode is ended when only muting sensor MutingSwitch22 ( MS_22 ) is actuated by the workpiece. " },

"body" : "Muting is the deliberate suppression of a safety function. This is necessary, for example, when material is to be transported into the hazardous area without causing the machine to stop. Muting is triggered by a muting sensor. The use of two or four muting sensors and the correct integration into the production process has to ensure that no person enters the hazardous area while the light grid is muted. Muting sensors can be proximity switches, photoelectronic barriers, limit switches, etc. which do not have to be fail-safe. Active muting mode has to be indicated by indicator lamps. There are sequential and parallel muting methods. Parallel muting with four muting sensors is used in this block. An execution of the forward direction of transport is listed below. The FB can be used in both directions: forward and backward. Muting should be activated by the MutingEnable signal from the process to prevent tampering. The input parameters of the function block contains the signals of the 4 muting sensors ( MutingSwitch11 , MutingSwitch12 , MutingSwitch21 , and MutingSwitch22 ), the OSSD signal of the \"active opto-electronic protective device\" S_AOPD_In , as well as 3 parameterizable times ( DiscTime11_12 , DiscTime21_22 , and MaxmutingTime ). The S_StartReset input shall only be activated if it is ensured that no hazardous situation can occur when the S-PLC is started. Example of SF_MutingPar in forward direction with four sensors No. Image Explanation 1 If the muting sensors MutingSwitch11 ( MS_11 ) and MutingSwitch12 ( MS_12 ) are actuated by a workpiece within the time DiscTime11_12 , then the muting mode is activated ( S_MutingActive = TRUE ). 2 Muting mode remains active as long as MutingSwitch11 (MS_11 ) and MutingSwitch12 (MS_12 ) are actuated by the workpiece. The workpiece can pass through the light grid without causing a machine stop. 3 Before the muting sensors MutingSwitch11 ( MS_11 ) and MutingSwitch12 ( MS_12 ) are deactivated, MutingSwitch21 ( MS_21 ) and MutingSwitch22 ( MS_22 ) have to be activated. This ensures that the muting mode remains active. The discrepancy time between the switching of MutingSwitch21 and MutingSwitch22 is monitored by the time DiscTime21_22 . 4 Muting mode is ended when either MutingSwitch21 ( MS_21 ) or MutingSwitch22 ( MS_22 ) is deactivated by the workpiece. MaxMutingTime is the maximum time that the muting mode may remain active. " },

"body" : "Muting is the deliberate suppression of a safety function. This is necessary, for example, when material is to be transported into the hazardous area without causing the machine to stop. Muting is triggered by a muting sensor. The use of two muting sensors and the correct integration into the production process has to ensure that no person enters the hazardous area while the light grid is muted. Muting sensors can be proximity switches, photoelectronic barriers, limit switches, etc. which do not have to be fail-safe. Active muting mode has to be indicated by indicator lamps. There are sequential and parallel muting methods. Parallel muting with two muting sensors is used in this block. An example is given below. The positioning of the sensors should be done according to IEC standards. The FB can be used in both directions: forward and backward. In this case, the current direction cannot be determined. Muting should be activated with the MutingEnable signal of the process control to prevent tampering. The input parameters of the function block contain the signals of the 2 muting sensors ( S_MutingSwitch11 and S_MutingSwitch12 ), the OSSD signal of the \"active opto-electronic protective device\" S_AOPD , as well as the two parameterizable times DiscTimeEntry and MaxMutingTime . The S_StartReset input shall only be activated if it is ensured that no hazardous situation can occur when the S-PLC is started. Example of SF_MutingPar in forward direction with 2 light barriers No. Image Explanation 1 When retroreflective sensors are used as muting sensors, they are generally arranged diagonally. In general, this arrangement of retroreflective sensors as muting sensors requires only two photoelectric sensors and only S_MutingSwitch11 (MS_11) and S_MutingSwitch12 (MS_12) are assigned. " },

"body" : "In accordance with the European standard, the SF_EnableSwitch function block supports the cancellation of the safety measure using enable switches when the relevant operating mode is selected and active. The corresponding operating mode (limitation of speed or movement energy, limitation of movement range) has to be selected outside this function block. The SF_EnableSwitch function block evaluates the signals of a 3-stage enable switch. The input parameters S_EnableSwitchCh1 and S_EnableSwitchCh2 process the following signal stages of the contacts E1 to E4 . SF_EnableSwitch switch positions The signals of E1+E2 have to be connected with the parameter S_EnableSwitchCh1 . The signals of E3+E4 have to be connected with the parameter S_EnableSwitchCh2 . The position of the enable switch is detected in the function block when using the signal sequence. The transition from position 2 to position 3 can be different from what is shown here. The switching direction (position 1 -> position 2\/position 3 -> position 2) can be detected in the function block if the defined signal sequence of the enable switch contacts is used. The cancellation of the safety measure can only be activated by the function block by changing from position 1 to position 2. Other switching directions or positions must not be used to cancel the safety measure. The user needs to use a suitable switching device as the enable switch. In addition, the user needs to ensure that the appropriate operating mode is selected in the application. (Automatic operation has to be deactivated for this operating mode, by applying appropriate measures). The operating mode is usually defined by an operating mode selector switch in conjunction with the SF_ModeSelector FB and the SF_SafeRequest FB. SF_EnableSwitch processes the confirmation of the \"safe state\" status using the S_SafetyActive parameter. When implemented in a safe application without confirmation, a static TRUE signal is associated with the S_SafetyActive parameter. The S_AutoReset input should be activated only if it is guaranteed that no hazard can occur when the S-PLC is started. " },

"body" : "The following safety functions are used in this example: When the emergency stop button is pressed, all dangerous movements must be stopped (via SF_EmergencyStop ) Emergency stop has the highest priority. After releasing the EStop pushbutton, a reset via S0 reset is required. The safety output is activated by pressing both pushbuttons of the two-hand control. Releasing any of the two-hand pushbuttons deactivates the safety output and stops the hazardous movement via the switching devices K1 and K2 (via SF_TwoHandControlTypeII ) The basic state and the operating state of the connected switching devices are monitored. If an error is detected, then the safety output cannot become operational. (via SF_EDM ) After switching on the safety or functional application, or after an emergency stop condition, the two-hand control has to be released and actuated again to reactivate the safety output (via SF_OutControl ). To ensure this for the functional restart, the process signal of the functional application is connected to the Activate input of the two-hand control FB THC_S2_S3 . (If the application process is restarted while the two-hand control is activated, then the device goes to status C0003 , which signals the error that both pushbuttons are pressed when activated and prevents a restart.) In this example, only one operating state exists.

The manual contains a description of functions in CODESYS Safety Extension as well as notices that must be followed unconditionally when creating an application. The exchange of network variables between safety controllers functions by means of the network variable exchange in CODESYS Standard. Safety network variables are transmitted by means of the modules in the SafetyNetVar library. In CODESYS Safety Extension , the Safety network variable list (Sender) and Safety network variable list (Receiver) objects are available for exchange. Properties of Safety NetVars The cross-communication between safety controllers is used for exchanging safety-oriented signals. Variables of the following type can be exchanged: SAFEBOOL , SAFEWORD , and SAFEINT . If cross-communication was configured using the Safety network variable list (Sender) and Safety network variable list (Receiver) objects and downloads to safety and standard controllers were performed, then the communication link is established automatically over the standard controllers of the safety controller. The safety controller always exchanges the variable value that the variable has at the end of the application cycle. All exchanged telegrams (variable values and received confirmations) are sent in sync to the application cycle in the output phase and received in the input phase. A sender can send the same variable to several receivers and it is programmatically and functionally independent of its receivers. The receivers must register with the sender for establishing safe communication. A configured variable exchange starts automatically, continues running automatically, and starts again automatically after the cause for interruption has been removed, when the following conditions are fulfilled: The routing of the standard controllers of sender and receiver(s) runs. Safe communication of sender and receiver runs. The communication path is fast enough, the cycles times are short enough, and the watchdog time is long enough. The NetVarReceiver and NetVarSender modules of the SafetyNetVar library are used for cross-communication. In addition, an instance of the NetVarSenderStack module is generated for each sender\/receiver relationship. If a sender-receiver association exists, then the associated sender is displayed in brackets in the device tree for each safety network variable list (receiver), and vice versa. If several safety network variable lists (receiver) are associated to one safety network variable list (sender), then [<-…] is displayed after the sender name in the device tree.

"body" : "The examples listed here are only for demonstrating the configuration of CODESYS Safety NetVars in a distributed project. They do not claim to use safety POUs according to specifications in a safety-critical environment. For this kind of environment, the instructions in the CODESYS Safety User Manual must always be observed. The following examples build on each other. In example 1, cross-communication is implemented between two controllers. In example 2, the project in example 1 is extended by one controller. This third controller is connected to the other two controllers. The POU of each safety application contains an SF_EmergencyStop POU which as an input signal would normally receive the output signal of a physical emergency stop switch. For simplicity, this output signal is simulated in the examples by a GVL with a global variable. By connecting the respective emergency stop switches with the safety network variables as an input signal of the SF_EmergencyStop POU, the SF_EmergencyStop POU is also triggered when the switch of a controller is triggered in the controllers connected via safety network variables. Example 2: Extension of the previous project with another device by \"creating\" the network variable components Requirement: The project from example 1 has been created and it is open. Add an additional standard controller to the project with a safety controller below it (context menu: Add Device ). Copy the POU and GVL objects from SafetyApp1 below the new safety controller. Rename the new SafetyApp to SafetyApp3 . Add one Safety network variable list (Sender) and two Safety network variable list (Receiver) objects below SafetyApp3 by means of the Add Object command. Open the Safety Configuration tabs of both safety network variable list (receiver) and select from the Associated Sender drop-down list the sender of SafetyApp1 for the first safety network variable list (receiver) and the sender of SafetyApp2 and for the second one. If necessary, modify the Watchdog time in the safety network variable list (receiver). The connection ID is preset with a project-wide unique value when the object is inserted. Therefore it no longer needs to be modified during the procedure described in this example. Declare the variable SApp3_EStop of data type SAFEBOOL in the new Safety network variable list (Sender) . The safety address of the variable list is preset with a project-wide unique value when the object is inserted. Therefore it no longer needs to be modified during this procedure. The group of variable list identifiers is also preset with a project-wide unique value in order to avoid conflicts. Modify the assignment in the POU of SafetyApp3 so that the variable Local_EStop is assigned to the variable SApp3_EStop . In this way, the value of the emergency stop switch is published by means of the Safety network variable list (Sender) . Select the AND operator, click Append Input in the context menu, and link this new input to the variable SApp1_EStop . The inputs of the AND operator are now linked to the Local_EStop , SApp2_EStop , and SApp1_EStop inputs. Set SafetyApp3 as the active application and build the application by clicking Build → Build . During the build operation, the system checks whether the project-wide safety network variable configuration matches and the SafetyApp3_Mapping is generated. In the following steps, you will modify SafetyApp2 . Add a new Safety network variable list (Receiver) to SafetyApp2 and select the sender network variable list of SafetyApp3 from the Associated Sender drop-down list. If necessary, modify the Watchdog time . Open the POU of SafetyApp2 and add a new input to the AND operator (context menu: Append Input ). Link this new input to the SApp3_EStop variable. In the following steps, you will modify SafetyApp1 . Add a new Safety network variable list (Receiver) to SafetyApp1 and select the sender network variable list of SafetyApp3 from the Associated Sender drop-down list. If necessary, modify the Watchdog time . Open the POU of SafetyApp1 and add a new input to the AND operator (context menu: Append Input ). Link this new input to the SApp3_EStop variable. As in the previous example, the network configuration is described with explicit addresses. Set the communication settings for all three controllers in the project so that it is possible to log in to the controllers later. Deactivate the option Use default values for destination network address and port (255.255.255.255, 1202) in all safety network variable lists. Type in the IP addresses of the respective remote terminals according to this figure. You have to modify the IP addresses of your network accordingly. For Safety App3 this operation is described in more detail in the following steps: Type in the Destination network address 192.168.0.22 of the controller with SafetyApp2 as the entry for the List identifiers 1080 1081 in the PLC Network tab of the safety network variable list (sender) of SafetyApp3 . Make sure that you assign the destination network addresses to the correct list identifiers, otherwise the transfer of network variables will not work. Open the safety network variable list (receiver) that imports the variable SApp2_EStop . Type in the Destination network address of the controller with SafetyApp2 192.168.0.22 . Then type in the Destination network address 192.168.0.1 for the controller with SafetyApp1 at the following locations: First in the safety network variable list (sender) for the list identifiers 1082 1083 and then in the safety network variable list (receiver) that imports the variable SApp1_EStop . Now the project is configured for cross-communication. To test the cross-communication example, first download the applications to all controllers involved and start the applications. Make sure that the respective SafetyAppX_Mapping is also running. The SAppX_EStop variables published using the safety network variables are now transferred to the POUs of the other SafetyApps with the value TRUE . This is the initial value that is written to the SAppX_EStop variables by the simulated emergency stop switches. If necessary, set the SF_EmergencyStop POUs by means of the Reset input and the connected bVar_Reset variables. Now you can trigger the POU SF_EmergencyStop in all three interconnected controllers by triggering the emergency stop signal in one controller. In the example, the emergency stop switch is simulated by setting the global variable Local_EStop to FALSE on one of the controllers and then writing the value for this controller by means of the command Debug → Write Values .

"body" : "Before making changes to the \"Safety network variable list (Sender)\" and \"Safety network variable list (Receiver)\" objects, you should log out from both the application of the corresponding standard controller and the corresponding safety application. Otherwise, any necessary dependent changes to these cannot be made correctly. Explanation of the editable configuration values of the safety network variable lists of the examples Tab: PLC Network : List identifiers : The list identifiers are required by the subordinate NetVarUDP protocol for assigning telegrams and must therefore be unique within the broadcast domain for a sender-receiver pair of a safety network variable list. List identifiers are given in pairs, as one value is required for each direction (sender -> receiver) and one value for the direction (receiver -> sender). Group of variable lists identifiers on main PLC (Only for safety network variable lists (Sender): This group defines a unique range of list identifiers to be used for this safety network variable list for sending. The values within one group do not overlap with the values of another group. Destination network address : If the broadcast option should not be used, then the IP address of the remote terminal with which communication is to take place has to be used for the destination network address. The IP address of the controller with the safety network variable list (sender) must therefore be entered at the receiver and the IP address of the controller with the safety network variable list (receiver) at the sender. Port : Can be modified if necessary (for example, because of routers or firewalls). The examples assume that no modification is necessary and the default value is retained. A connection pair (sender\/receiver) of a safety network variable list must use the same port. Tab: Safety Configuration (Safety network variable list (Sender) Safety address : This address must have a network-wide unique value, as it is used for internal identification of the connection (see: Safety User Manual). In the example, therefore, care is taken that it is unique throughout the project. It is assumed that no additional safety network variables have been configured in the same network. Maximum number of receivers : This setting remains at the default value of 4 in the examples in order to provide a maximum expansion level of four intercommunicating controllers. If this value is changed afterwards, then both the safety application and the associated applications of the standard controller have to be downloaded again. Increasing the value also increases resource consumption, as the sender already reserves resources for unused connections. Therefore, the value should not be set higher than required. Tab: Safety Configuration (Safety network variable list (Receiver) Connection ID : This ID must have a network-wide unique value, as the connection ID: is used for internal identification of the connection (see: Safety User Manual). In the example, therefore, care is taken that it is unique throughout the project. It is assumed that no additional safety network variables have been configured in the same network. Watchdog time : Must be set in a sensible way for the example depending on the system. For additional requirements or restrictions on the value to be used, refer to the Safety User Manual. " },

"body" : "Open the POU from SafetyApp in the project and insert an AND operator before the POU SF_EmergencyStop so that the output of the AND operator is connected to the POU input E_StopIn . Assign the global variable Local_EStop to the first entry of the AND operator. In the POU, declare a local variable bVar_Reset of data type BOOL and link this to the Reset input of the POU SF_EmergencyStop . This is needed for debugging. In order to prepare the signal of the emergency stop switch (global variable Local_EStop ) for publication by means of a safety network variable (sender), create the variable SApp1_EStop of data type SAFEBOOL in the safety network variable list (sender). Add a new network in the POU by clicking Insert Network (below) , and assign the value of the variable Local_EStop (signal of the emergency stop switch) to the variable SApp1_EStop . Open the properties dialog of SafetyApp and rename it to SafetyApp1 . Now create a second controller in your project by copying and pasting the standard controller configured in the previous steps with the safety controller below it. For the copied standard and safety controller, the following modifications have to be made first. Modifications to the inserted copy: Rename the SafetyApp1 object to SafetyApp2 because the name of a safety application object must be unique in a project. Set SafetyApp2 as the active application and click Build → Build . The build results in a new mapping application SafetyApp2_Mapping being created below the new standard controller. After the build, several errors regarding safe cross-communication are displayed in the message view ( View → Messages ). This helps to detect current configuration errors, which should be corrected first. To do this, consider the following error displayed messages: Error P0100 means that the group of list identifiers in the project is not unique (because the Safety network variable list (Sender) object was copied). To correct the error, open the safety network variable list (sender) object of the SafetyApp2 application. Then type in a value for Group of variable list identifiers on main PLC in the PLC Network tab. This value must not already be assigned in the project (example: 2 ). For a clear naming in the example, the name of the published variable must still be modified. To do this, open the Safety Configuration tab of the safety network variable list (sender) of the SafetyApp2 application and rename the declared variable to SApp2_EStop . According to the Safety User Manual, the use of safety network variables requires that the safety addresses of all applied senders are unique. That is why you type in a new Safety address of this variable list in the Safety Configuration tab of the safety network variable list (sender) of the SafetyApp2 application (example: 1001 ). Error P0200 means that a permitted sender has still not been selected for a safety network variable list (receiver). This can be corrected as follows: Open the safety network variable list (receiver) of SafetyApp2 (for example by double-clicking the error message in the message view). Then select the sender variable list from the Associated Sender drop-down list that contains the SApp1_EStop variable published in step 4. If desired for the programming logic, the local name of the variable can now be renamed. In the example, this is reserved as SApp1_EStop_1 because the SApp1_EStop variable is already defined by copying the application. Because the POU in the next step is modified, change the name in the open safety network variable list (receiver) back to SApp1_EStop so that it agrees again with the published variables. Because the ConnectionIDs of all applied receivers have to be unique in the network, you have to type in another unique Connection ID in the copied safety network variable list (receiver) in the Safety Configuration tab. Open the POU of SafetyApp2 . Assign the variable SApp1_EStop to the second entry of the AND operator. Assign the local variable Local_EStop (signal of the emergency stop switch of SafetyApp2) to the sender variable SApp2_EStop . Set SafetyApp1 again as the active application and click Build → Build . Double-click the error P0200 in the message view. The safety network variable list (receiver) of SafetyApp1 opens. Select the sender variable list of SafetyApp2 from the Associated Sender drop-down list. By linking to the sender of the other controller, the list identifiers are updated at the area defined in the sender. Open the POU of SafetyApp1 . Assign the available remote variable SApp2_EStop to the second entry of the AND operator. Rebuild SafetyApp1 . No more errors are reported. In the following steps, you perform the network configuration with explicit addresses. First, the communication settings for both controllers in the project must be set accordingly so that it is possible to log in to the controllers later. If a broadcast to network address 255.255.255.255 is not desired or not possible for technical reasons (for example, due to the router settings), then the controllers that can should communicate via SafetyNetvars can also be defined explicitly. For the above example with two controllers involved, the network settings on the PLC Network tab of the sender and receiver objects are defined as follows: First deactivate the option Use default values for destination network address and port (255.255.255.255, 1202) in the PLC Network tab of all safety network variable lists of the project. Type in the IP addresses of the respective remote terminal according to this figure. You have to modify the IP addresses of your network accordingly. The destination network address 192.168.0.22 has to be given the safety network variable lists of SafetyApp1 and the IP address 192.168.0.1 for the safety network variable lists of SafetyApp2 . The entry at the sender must be made for the entry where the list identifiers match those at the corresponding receiver. This is done so that the packages can be assigned correctly by the subordinate layer. In order to detect for which of the sender entries an IP is entered, a list of connected receivers can be displayed at the sender by means of the Show receivers button in the Safety Configuration tab. The editor of the connected safety network variable list (receiver) can be opened quickly by double-clicking an entry in this list. In the editor, you can check which pair of list identifiers is used by the receiver. The project is configured for the cross-communication example. To test the project, download both applications to the safety controllers. You might also have to make sure that the respective SafetyAppX_Mapping is downloaded to the controller and started. Afterwards, start the applications and reset any SF_EmergencyStop POUs by means of the Reset input and the bVar_Reset connected variables in step 3. Now you can trigger the POU SF_EmergencyStop in both interconnected controllers by triggering the emergency stop signal in one controller. In the example, the emergency stop switch is simulated by setting the global variable Local_EStop to FALSE on one of the two controllers and then writing the value for this controller by means of the command Debug → Write Values .
