All CODESYS software components are regularly checked for potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, the CODESYS Group is committed to resolve verified security vulnerabilities within a reasonable period of time. In our Security Whitepaper (PDF), you will find all important information about CODESYS Security. An important part of the security measures is the use of certificates for the encryption of source code, boot application, packages, and above all communication between CODESYS Development System and the PLC. The use of X.509 certificates is supported for this. What is protected and where?

"body" : "The installed CODESYS Development System is at risk from hackers in that additional installations and used libraries could be manipulated or replaced. The signing of add-on packages (in CODESYS Package Designer ), libraries (when saving in CODESYS ), and HTML5 controls (in the visualization element repository) helps against this. Create a project for programming your application(s) in CODESYS . Create a project user management. Configure credentials for users and their permissions. You can individually configure the Access Control in the Properties of each object. Encrypt the project in the Security category of the Project Settings with at least a password – or even better with a certificate . For more information, see: Secure Development \/ Protecting the Source CodeIf you create a library which should be installed for use in other projects, then protect it with a signature. Every component which can be additionally installed offers hackers the opportunity to attack the programming system. For more information, see: Protecting and Signing Compiled LibrariesAs a library developer, you can use the CmpX509Cert.library library to create certificates for specific functions blocks on the PLC. For more information, see: library Manage the project in a version control system such as CODESYS Git , for the purpose of data security and secure exchange with others. For more information, see: Managing a project in Before downloading the created application: Encrypt and\/or sign the application with a certificate . The necessary actions are best started in the Properties dialog of the application on the Security tab. For more information, see: Encrypting and\/or Signing the Boot ApplicationYou can use the CmpX509Cert. library library to create certificates specifically for a certain IEC application or a unit from it. For more information, see: library Configure the connection to the PLC and protect it: Make sure that the Encrypted Communication security setting is enabled in the device editor. Scan the network for the PLC. After selecting the PLC, you will be prompted to create and install a certificate for encrypted communication which is valid for at least a limited period of time. When prompted, enable the device user management. At the next prompt, configure a device user. Log in to the PLC with the credentials assigned for this purpose. For more information, see: Encrypting Communication with a Certificate and Changing the Security PolicyYou can now run the application on the PLC. Consider whether you want to install a long-term certificate for encrypted communication at this time. Check the runtime system security policy and adjust it if necessary. For more information, see: Encrypting Communication with a Certificate and Changing the Security PolicyThe application is running on the controller. You can do the following for improved security: Audit log , Exclude specific critical user actions via application , Use PLC operating modes , Configure interactive login . Do you use an OPC UA Server and symbol sets for the exchange with the PLC? Encrypt the communication between the OPC UA Server and Client with a certificate which can be set up using the security screen when the connection is first established. Configure the CODESYS user and rights management also for actions on the OPC UA Server. Restrict access to symbols for specific device user groups. For more information, see: Using a Secure OPC UA Server, Configuring Symbol SetsDo you use a WebVisu or TargetVisu? For visualizations, you should use the \"runtime-based user management\", which is linked to the user management on the controller. For a WebVisu, communication with the web server must be certificate-encrypted. You should also always sign the used HTML5 controls because they can also be installed and therefore offer a target for hackers. You should also encrypt communication with the relevant PLC for a remote TargetVisu. For more information, see: Signing an HTML5 Control, Protecting the Communication between the WebVisu and the Browser, and Encrypting Communication with a Remote TargetVisuDo you use the Automation Server (CAS)? You have already assigned a server password at the time of purchase. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) when logging in. Configure user management on the CAS and assign specific access permissions for actions on the server and on server objects. Configure the certificate-encrypted connection between the Automation Server and the Edge Gateway. A \"Quick Setup\" makes this easier. Use the \"Audit Trail\" function to make actions and access traceable. For more information, see: Security for the Use CODESYS Git If possible, use SecureString passwords when using the scripting interface. For more information, see: Managing a project in Think about backup actions in time. Possible recovery of lost data is also part of the security measures.

"body" : "CODESYS supports the signing with X.509 certificates. What is an X.509 certificate? The certificates for encryption in CODESYS Development System or for communication with the PLC can be self-signed or CA-signed. Which certification level is used depends on the security demands. You can create certificates with special tools or in the CODESYS environment. CA-signed certificates must be created by a trusted external Certification Authority (CA) or by a CA located at the operator's facility. To obtain a CA-signed certificate, you can send a self-generated certificate to a CA via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and then reinstall it on your computer or on the PLC. The CA uses the data from the CSR to create the X.509 certificate for the PLC. When signing the CSR, the transfer of the following \"x509v3 extensions\" from the CSR is required: Key Usage , Extended Key Usage , Subject Alternative Name , each with the Critical flag. You can create self-signed certificates yourself with your own private key, but they are not signed by a CA. When you create self-signed certificates in the CODESYS environment, you get help from dialogs and encryption wizards. A self-signed certificate is useful for testing purposes or as a temporary solution until a CA-signed certificate is available. Certificate management on the local Windows computer : Valid certificates for the encryption of a CODESYS project and for the exchange between the PLC and CODESYS Development System must be stored in the local Windows Certificate Store ( certmgr ) on your computer. To install a certificate file from the local file system in the Windows Certificate Store , double-click the file in the file directory. Then the appropriate import wizard will help you. Certificate management on the PLC is the responsibility of the system operator. For more information, see: Certificates of the PLCThe Security Screen provides an interface for certificate handling for the project as well as for the certificates required for communication with the PLC. In the case of communication between CODESYS and the PLC, the Security Screen provides an alternative to the corresponding commands in the PLC Shell of the device editor. " },

"body" : "For general information about certificates in the CODESYS Development System environment, see: Certificates for When handling PLC certificates, the role of the \"user\" must be differentiated. The system operator needs to make sure that only a user in the role of system administrator can configure and renew certificates in the PLC certificate store. Only a system administrator may also modify the certificate revocation list on the PLC. Certificate store of the PLC , Windows Certificate Store The configuration of the PLC certificate store defines the use cases for which the PLC expects valid certificates from CODESYS Development System . These must then be installed on your computer in the local Windows Certificate Store . CODESYS makes it easier to create and manage the necessary PLC certificates using encryption wizards and the Security Screen view, Devices tab. Alternatively, you could also use the PLC Shell commands of the device editor. At both locations, you can view the certificate store of the currently connected PLC and create certificates. Both locations also provide an overview of all \"use cases\" on the PLC for which a certificate is required. They show whether a certificate already exists. Examples of use cases: Encrypted communication , OPC UA Server . In the use case, CODESYS first checks whether the required certificates are available as Trusted Certificates in the local Windows Certificate Store . Self-signed certificates If a valid certificate has not yet been installed locally on the PLC for an application, then you can generate a self-signed certificate on the Security Screen or via the PLC Shell on the controller so that you can continue working with it immediately. The self-signed certificate is initially created in the Own Certificates category. You can move it later to the Trusted Certificates category so that the PLC trusts it in future. For example, certificates are classified as untrusted due to a blacklist, or they are in quarantine for explicit verification because the PLC itself was unable to immediately check them. After checking is completed, you can move certificates to the Trusted Certificates category. You can also delete certificates from the PLC. For more information, see: Generating Self-Signed CertificatesCA-signed certificates To achieve a higher level of security, you should replace a self-signed certificate with a CA-signed certificate . If you do not yet have a CA-signed certificate, then you can request one from a CA office ( Certificate Signing Request , CSR). To do this, export the relevant PLC certificate file from the Security Screen or via the PLC Shell to the local file system. After the signed CA certificate has been returned, import it back into the PLC certificate store and the local Windows Certificate Store . The direct generation of a CSR is possible via the SPS shell , and with CODESYS Security Agent V1.4.0.0 or higher also from Security-Screen (tab devices ). For more information, see: Requesting and Providing CA-Signed Certificates via the PLC ShellCSR via Security Screen, devices Note that the CA-signed certificate has applied the following entries from the CSR: Key Usage , Extended Key Usage , Subject Alternative Name , each with the Critical flag. For more information, see: Requesting and Providing CA-Signed Certificates via the PLC ShellMultiple certificates for the same use case If multiple certificates are available on the PLC for one use case, then the system uses the following ordered steps to determine which certificate to use: Certificate which was created directly by the user (currently not supported) Filtering of existing certificates by: Subject (user of the certificate) Key usage Extended key usage Valid timestamp Dividing of detected, valid certificates as \"signed\" and \"self-signed\" Filtering of signed certificates, and the self-signed certificates by the following criteria: Longest validity period Strongest key Renewal of certificates The system operator needs to make sure that a certificate is renewed in time. For more information, see: Renewing a CertificateCertificate revocation list The certificate revocation list can currently only be exchanged via the PLC Shell .

When creating a CSR ( Certificate Signing Request ), the PLC adds all required X509 extensions to the certificate signing request. As a result, a certification authority (CA) may add some extensions, but may not omit the existing extensions. If the extensions of the CSR do not exist in the signed certificate, then it cannot be used by the PLC. Note that the CA-signed certificate has applied the following entries from the CSR: Key Usage , Extended Key Usage , Subject Alternative Name , each with the Critical flag.The following extensions must be included in the CSR: Key Usage , Extended Key Usage , Subject Alternative Name , each with the Critical flag. First, you generate a certificate request for all required certificates or components ( CSR = Certificate Signing Request ). These can also become client certificates (for example, for the OPC UA client). To do this, click the PLC Shell tab of the controller. In the input line, type in the cert-createcsr command. Syntax: cert-createcsr [<number retrieved by \\\"cert-getapplist\\\">] [encoding=Base64 | ASN.1] <number retrieved by \\\"cert-getapplist\\\"> Optional: Specify the number of a single component from the output of cert -getapplist . If not specified, certificates are generated for all generated components. encoding=Base64 | ASN.1 Optional: Specify the export format (default setting: ASN.1 ). ANS.1 : Binary file format for certificates, CSR, and asymmetric keys. Base64 : Textual representation of ASN.1 data, based on Base64 encoding. The file format may be specified by CAs. Then the CSR is automatically generated in the correct format. Otherwise, lossless conversion of one format to the other is also possible. For example, OpenSSL can be used to do this: openssl req -in <file name> -inform <DER|PEM> -out <file name_new> -outform <PEM|DER> DER corresponds to ASN.1; PEM corresponds to Base64. Click the Log tab and then click the refresh button. In the log entries, you can see that the CSR files were generated. Click the Files tab and open the file path cert\/export in the right side of the Runtime dialog. The export folder contains the generated CSR files. Example: 0_CmpsecureChannl.csr, 1_CmpApp.csr, 2_CmpWebServer.csr Select a file path where you want to insert the CSR files in the left side of the Host dialog, mark the CSR files in the right side of the dialog, and click . The CSR files are copied to the required folder. These certificate requests can be signed by a certificate authority (CA). As a result, you get a certificate signed from the certification authority. In the steps that follow, you import these signed certificates to your controller. After restarting the controller, the CA-signed certificates are used automatically. Alternatively, you could also use the 0_Global: Produkt Security Agent to transfer the certificates to the controller. For more information, see: CODESYS Security Agent Select the Path cert\/import in the right side of the Runtime dialog. In the left side of the Host dialog, select the path in the file system where you saved the signed certificates and selected the certificates. Click . The certificates are copied to the cert\/import folder. Click the PLC Shell tab. Type the cert-import own <file name of the certificate.cer> command in the input line of the tab and press the Enter key. The signed certificates are available to the runtime servers. In the configuration file of the controller (for example, CODESYSControl.cfg ), the name of the organization can be set in the certificate for an OPC UA server with the following entry: [CmpOPCUAServer] SECURITY.CompanyOrOrganizationName=\"<organization name>\" If the CODESYS Security Agent is installed, then it is also possible to edit the Communication Settings on the communication settings tab of the device editor.

"body" : "In CODESYS V3 SP20 and higher, library projects *.compiled-library-v3 and *.compiled-library can be saved both with and without a certificate signature. In CODESYS V3 SP15 and higher, a certificate is always used for the signing of library projects ( *.compiled-library-v3 ). The signing can be enforced by means of a setting in the security screen . Then for generating a compiled library, you need a certificate suitable for code signing in your user profile. With compiler version 3.5.15.0 and higher, a better memory format is used. For library projects that must be compatible with CODESYS versions < 3.5.15.0 ( *.compiled-library ), only the less secure signing with a private key and an associated token is possible. These deprecated methods should only be used for reasons of compatibility. Settings are configured on the Signing tab of the Project Information dialog. Signing a library with a certificate Requirement: You have a valid certificate for signing on your computer. For more information about certificate handling, see: Certificates for Create a library project. Open the Users tab of the Security Screen view. Use the button to open the dialog for certificate selection. From the Available certificates... area, select a certificate for the digital signature and use the button to move it to the upper window. After confirming the selection, the certificate is displayed in the table under Digital Signature . In the Security Level section, select the Enforce signing of compiled libraries option Click the File → Save Project as Compiled Library command to save the library project. The library is automatically signed. If the signature check does not confirm the integrity, for example because the library has been manipulated, then the library cannot be used. In CODESYS V3 SP15 and higher, library signing is always based on certificates. To perform this kind of signing, see the help page: Command: Save Project as Compiled Library command. In contrast to deprecated signing by using the settings in the Project Information – Signing dialog, the entire library is signed with the certificate. When using the command-line interface you can use the option: --signaturethumbprint use to sign a compiled library. " },

Note the following regarding project protection: You can provide the project with simple write protection to prevent unauthorized changes. In order to protect only certain objects in a project against changes, or to allow access only to certain users, you can use a user and permission management . However, such write and access protection is not enough as a means of protecting the know-how of the project POUs. Both CODESYS itself, Automation Platform plug-ins, and people with knowledge about the project file format can view or modify POUs created with CODESYS . Encryption is recommended for know-how protection . Use at least a user-specific password , but preferably a certificate . Using the \" CODESYS Security Key\" (dongle) is no longer recommended. The desired type of project encryption is enabled in the Project Settings . You can achieve know-how protection of a library project by providing it as a target-system-independent \"protected library\" ( *.compiled-library , *.compiled-library-v3 ). The library file no longer contains source code in this format, but only encrypted precompile context. The compiler is still able to interpret this data. Whether access by other CODESYS components or additional plug-ins is possible depends on their functionality and is to be observed in individual cases. Signing can increase protection. " },

"body" : "In a CODESYS project, you can manage user accounts with different permissions. For each user account, you can define the actions with which the user can access a project object. You create users and groups in the Users and Groups category of the Project Settings . Assign general permissions to the created users and groups in the permissions dialog of the user management ( Project → User Management → Permissions ). For individual project objects, this is done on the Access Control tab in the object properties. Note the following before creating users and groups: Permissions can only be assigned to user groups. As a result, you need to assign each user to a group. There is automatically always a group Everyone and by default every user and every other group is initially a member of this group. As a result, each user account is automatically provided with at least the defined default permissions. You cannot delete the Everyone group or remove members from this group. You can only rename the group. By default, Everyone does not have the permission to change the current user, group, and permission configuration. There is automatically always an Owner group which contains an Owner user. In V3.5 and higher, only the Owner initially has permission to change the current user, group, and permission configuration in a new project. As a result, only the Owner can assign this permission to another group. Initially, the Owner can log in with the Owner user name and an empty password. You can add more users to the Owner group or remove users from it, but at least one member has to remain. Like Everyone , you cannot delete the Owner group and it always has all permissions granted. This prevents a project from being rendered unusable by denying all permissions to all groups. You can rename both the Owner group and the Owner user. When the programming system or a project is restarted, no user is initially logged in to the project. However, the user can then login via a specific user account with user name and password in order to get the permissions defined for the account. Each project has its own user management. Therefore, in order to get specific permissions to a library integrated into the project, for example, the user must explicitly log in to the library project. Users and groups defined in different projects are not the same, even if they have the same names. A user management in a project only makes sense when it is connected with corresponding permissions assignment for the access to project and objects. The general permission management for a project is done in the Permissions dialog of the user management ( Project → User Management → Permissions ). You can also change the permissions to an individual project object on the Access Control tab of the Properties of the object. There are default menu commands under Project → User Management for logging into and out of a project as a defined user. A password manager is used to manage the credentials on your computer. Note the following before assigning permissions: In a new project, CODESYS always sets all permissions to execute actions on objects with the default value granted (default permission). The only exception to this is the permission to change the current user, group, and permission configuration. Initially only the Owner group has this permission. If you are member of a group which is allowed to change permissions, then you can do this at any time for each permission when working further on a project. You change a permission by switching between granted and denied or by clearing to the default. For more information, see below: \"Using permissions to protect objects\". In V3.5 and higher, only the Owner initially has permission to change the current user, group, and permission configuration in a new project. As a result, only the Owner can assign this permission to another group. CODESYS saves the user password and makes it inaccessible. If you forget a password, the user account will be unusable. If you forget the Owner password, then the entire project may become unusable. " },

When offered by the device, you can view the user management for the device here as well as edit it in synchronization mode (not in online mode). Here, you can grant or deny specific permissions on the controller to the defined user groups. Then users need the credentials defined here to log in to the controller. The device user management can already be set up in the device description. For CODESYS Control for <device> SL with version >= 3.5 SP17, user management is enforced as a communication policy by default. For older versions back to 3.5 SP14, it must be explicitly enabled and enforced. Even older versions only offer very simple user management. Note the commands in the Online → Security menu. You can easily add, edit, or remove a user account on the controller where you are currently logged in. In order for the Access Rights tab to be available in the device editor, the corresponding CODESYS option must be enabled in the device editor and unlocked in the device description. If the device editor dialog is not available, then contact the vendor of the controller. Permissions can be granted to groups only, not individual users. Therefore, every user must be a member of a group. There are predefined default user groups (see below). These and additional groups and users are configured in the device editor on the Users and Groups tab. After the user management has been set up on the controller, you can configure the permissions to it. If the user management of a device is not yet \"active\", then it can be enabled by one of the following actions: Switch to synchronized mode in the device editor on the Users and Groups tab. Add a new user by using the Online → Security → Add Device User command. Agree after being prompted to enable when establishing the connection and login to the controller for the first-time .

There are two root objects for the two kinds of objects: Runtime objects → Device : In these objects, all objects are managed which have online access in the controller and must therefore control the permissions. A Device → UserManagement object also exists here and below it an Access Rights object, a Groups object, and a Users object.

The child objects inherit the permissions from the root object (also Device or \" \/ \"). If a permission of a user group is denied or explicitly granted to a parent object, then this affects all child objects. A single permission can be explicitly granted or denied (green plus sign or red minus sign), or remain \"neutral\" (light gray character). Neutral means that the permission has been neither explicitly granted nor denied. In this case, the permission of the parent object applies. If no permission has been explicitly granted or denied in the entire hierarchy of the object, then it is denied by definition. As a result, all permissions are initially denied (exception: the permission for the View action). Initially, this permission is explicitly granted for every user group both on the Device runtime object as well as on the \" \/ \" file system object. This allows read access to all objects, unless it is explicitly denied in child objects. For an overview table for the objects, see: Tab: Access Rights .

A controller certificate installed in this way is valid for only 30 days. This gives you time for the following long-term solutions: Create an additional self-signed certificate with a longer time period (for example, 365 days). You can do this on the security screen even if a certificate already exists. Alternatively, you could also use the PLC shell commands in the device editor. See the two sections below: \"Configuring a controller certificate with a more long-term validity period for encrypted communication...\" Import a CA-signed certificate. This is currently only possible via the PLC shell commands of the runtime.

When you confirm the dialog, the certificate is installed in the local store and you are logged in to the controller. In the future, communication with the controller will be encrypted automatically with this controller certificate. To increase security for key exchange for controllers < V3.5.13.0, you can generate Diffie-Hellman parameters on the controller. To do this, type the command cert-gendhparams in the input line. This is no longer required for controllers >= V3.5.13.0. Caution: Generating the Diffie-Hellman parameters can last for several minutes or even several hours.

Certificate-encrypted communication : The data exchange between the CODESYS Automation Server and the CODESYS Automation Server and the Edge Gateway and also the data exchange between the Edge Gateway and the PLC is TLS-encrypted based on X.509 certificates. Configuring communication between the CODESYS Automation Server and the Edge Gateway is configured only with authorization and in a secure environment (settings in the gateway.cfg file). For protection of the Edge Gateway device against unauthorized access, see Edge Gateway Security. For an encrypted connection with CODESYS Automation Server the Edge Gateway requires the CA certificate, which has signed the certificate of the CODESYS Automation Server . Because the CODESYS Automation Server runs on AWS and CODESYS has issued the certificate by AWS, there are 5 possible” Amazon Root CA \"(Example: cn=Amazon Root CA 1, 0=Amazon, C=US). These certificates are automatically stored in the .pki directory when the Edge Gateway is connected to the CODESYS Automation Server via CODESYS Automation Server Connector or CODESYS Service Tool . In order for the web browser to accept the secure connection, the CA certificate used must also be valid in the browser or operating system. This is the case by default because AWS is classified as trusted. (Local Windows Certificate Store, Trusted Root Certification Authorities category, Certificates, Amazon Root CA...). View SPSen Gateways displays the thumbprint of the private key that has been generated in the local certificate store for the root certificate of the PLC. If a certificate has expired, then you can renew it in the Connect or Reconfigure Edge Gateways view. To do this, the configured Edge Gateway must be connected to the Automation Server and the configuration mode must be enabled. The new certificate is valid for 6 months. For more information, see: Connect or Reconfigure Edge Gateways The encrypted connection between the Edge Gateway and the PLC can be configred from CODESYS Automation Server using a “Quick Setup”.

In the simplest case, the key is a password or 1 secret key, or a key pair (secret\/public key). The public key is usually provided embedded in a certificate . Data can be encrypted so that only the authorized recipient can decrypt and read it. Encryption and decryption are usually performed using symmetric procedures. In addition, the recipient of the data can be shown that it originates from a sender of integrity and has not been altered. To do this, the data is signed, which is usually done using asymmetric encryption. " },

"body" : "In order for the irrefutable ownership and integrity of a message to be verifiable (integrity, authenticity), it should be provided with a signature. Encryption is also used for a signature (in this case, asymmetric encryption). The sender needs the public key of the recipient and the recipient needs the private key that belongs to this public key. The sender uses his own private key for signing. The recipient can verify the signature with the public key associated with this private key. The following steps are usually taken: Sender: Determines a unique hash value over the data (H) Sender: Encrypts the hash value with private key (He) Recipient: Also calculates the hash value and decrypts the He with the public key and compares the two values. This allows the sender to be identified uniquely and verifies that the sender possesses the private key. Hash procedures are necessary for this: One characteristic is the unique \"fingerprint\" of the data (for example, the checksum of the data). The hash functions are very low-collision, which means that it is very difficult to find\/construct two different data for a single hash value. " },
