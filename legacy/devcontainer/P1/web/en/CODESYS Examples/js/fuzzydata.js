Example: ABORTED or HELD . Dual States (blue): Machine states which are of the Acting State and Wait State type. Only one state of this type is defined in PackML: EXECUTE . A state transition is executed by an action, such as Start or Stop . PackML also allows for the definition of custom unit modes. For example, custom unit modes can be created for setup or maintenance. The contained machine states are a subset of the maximum machine states. Only one unit mode can be active at a time, but it is possible to switch between unit modes. This task is handled by the unit mode manager.

"body" : "For an introduction and documents about BACnet\/IP and BBMD, see BACnet Community – Developer Aids . To simulate a complex network environment, a LANCOM VPN router is used. There are two VLANs to separate the BACnet devices. BACnet broadcasts (also IP\/UDP broadcasts) to devices outside of the VLAN are rejected by the LANCOM VPN router. As a result, the BACnet devices in one VLAN cannot communicate directly with the BACnet devices in the other VLAN, but need \"their\" BBMD to do so. The LANCOM VPN router is configured to perform IP routing between the two VLANs. This makes sure that the BBMDs can communicate \"peer-to-peer\" (P2P) via IP. In general, the BBMD configuration should be a \"fully connected star\". In this particular example, the BBMD configuration is simple: the two BBMDs only need to recognize each other. Network view: Application view: To demonstrate that the BACnet devices can communicate properly, each device executes a \"client read property\" from another device and sets its AV1.PV to the read value. Analog_Value[1].Present_Value (short form: AV1.PV ) BACDEV1 increases its AV1.PV after successful reading. In this way, you can see that all BACnet devices increase your AV1.PV when the \"ring\" is closed (or not interrupted). " },

Look at the Startup Parameters tab on the device. The General tab shows the EtherCAT address used to select the device. For the EtherCAT_Master device under the General tab, you need to set the correct source address where the device is connected. SoE: First, the program has to wait until the EtherCAT Master is ready. Afterwards, the IDN number 32 is read from device 1001 which was already set at startup. In addition, an IDN is written to the device and afterwards it is read again one time as a UINT value and as a byte array. You can read the name, attribute, unit, minimum, maximum, and value of an IDN. To do this, use the specific value at byElem . The \" byDrive \" value is not set because the used device has only one channel (=axis). The index of the EtherCAT Master is set at usiCom and the address at uiDevice .

After that the already set parameter is read from the device 1002 in a byte array and as DWORD . In addition, a parameter of four bytes is written and read afterwards. A parameter larger than four bytes is also written in this example. So far, only the parameter values are used, but you can also read the complete entry into a byte array. These values are device-specific. All function blocks contain a udiSdoAbort variable. If an operation is canceled, then this variable returns an abort code. The error for this code can be found in the CANopen specification. FoE: This function shows how to use File over EtherCAT to download a fictional firmware. After the EtherCAT Master is ready, memory for the complete firmware will be allocated. Then the specific slave is set to boot mode to download the firmware. When the download is finished, the memory will be released. The upload function has no direct relation to the firmware example. It is just to show how the instance is called. " },

Visualization: The Clock visualization builds an analogue clock with multiple ellipses and polygons. It is possible to create multiple references to this clock. To do this, a frame has to be added in the main visualization. Right-click the frame and click Frame Selection” . The visualization can be selected there. For the display of the time, a placeholder called FB_CLOCK ” is defined in the interface editor of “ Clock_Visu . This variable is used to animate the clock hands. In order to reference the clock, the variable for the placeholder has to be set in the properties editor at the “ References ” point. In this way, it is possible to reference multiple clocks (for example, with different time zones). " },

The recently included image is then assigned a unique ID. The example also shows what you need to do to make an element rotate after a mouse event. Wherever an image is displayed, its ID is referenced from the image pool. For example, a visualization element which displays an image uses the ID to reference that image in its Static ID element property. Some mouse events are directly supported by the visualization: OnMouseClick , OnMouseDown , OnMouseLeave , OnMouseEnter , OnMouseUp und OnMouseMove Other events (double-click, drag) are implemented in the MouseEvents program. For example, the color of the element changes when an event occurs. Elements can rotate in two different ways. A distinction is made between interior and normal rotation. In both cases, the element rotates around the midpoint (center of rotation). However, in the case of interior rotation, the element also rotates around itself (self-rotation), which is not the case with the normal rotation. " },

"body" : "In this example, trend data is saved by the trend recording manager and then read by the VisuTrendStorageAccess API using ST code. This allows for the retrieval of historical data. Moreover, the trend data can be exported. Four tasks are defined in the TrendStorage API Example.project sample project. The standard task calls the PLC_PRG program in order to simulate data. The simulated data is are saved in a database by the TrendRecordingTask task and the \"Trend Recording Manager\" component. The VISU_TASK task is responsible for refreshing the visualization. The actual reading of trend data is done in the Task200ms task, the TrendStorageAPI_TestProg program, and the TrendStorageReader function block. The ITrendStorageWriterListener interface is used for the active notification of new data. For this purpose, the TrendStorageWriterListener function block implements the ITrendStorageWriterListener interface and is registered for the TrendStorageReader function block. When new data is saved, the DataWritten method is called with the start and end time stamps and the number of saved records. The TrendStorageReader function block and the Read method are used to read records. eError2 := instTrendStorageReader.Read(liTimstampFrom := liTimstampFrom2, liTimstampTo := liTimstampTo2,itfTrendStorageReaderConsumer := instTrendStorageReaderConsumer); The TimeStampRead and ValueRead methods of instTrendStorageReaderConsumer are then automatically called for each value. In the example, the TrendStorageReaderConsumer function block implements the ITrendStorageReaderConsumer interface and writes the values to the controller console in CSV format. If the size of the returned data would block the database for too long, then ETrendStorageReaderErrors.AdditionalReadCallRequired is returned as an error code. The read operation has to be continued at a later time by calling the ContinueReading method with the same parameters. " },

"body" : "Application: TraceRecordingExample The application shows how to record and store values of variables by means of the trace object in the device tree and the Trace visualization element. To do this, the application has to be download to the controller and started. Steps to store and load recordings by means of the Trace visualization element: In the visualization, adapt the paths for Store trace and Load trace if necessary. Note: Absolute paths are not allowed. Click the Start Trace button to start the trace. Click the Start recording trigger button to trigger the recording. Click the Store trace button to store the trace. Click the Load trace button to load the trace. (Restriction: This only works if the trace has been stored with the currently running application.) Steps to store and load recordings by means of the trace object in the device tree: Configure whether or not the trace should be started by means of a menu command or a recording condition. To do this, in the recording settings ( Configuration ), select or clear the Enable Trigger option. Click Trace → Download to download the trace to the controller. Click Trace → Start Trace to start the trace. If you have selected the Enable Trigger option, then the Start Trace menu command is disabled. Then the trace starts automatically after the download and is stopped by the trigger event. The Reset Trigger command restarts the trace. Click Trace → Store Trace to store the trace. Click Trace → Load Trace to load the trace. Application: IECTraceConfiguration The application uses structured text to directly configure a trace element. The corresponding functions of the trace manager are implemented in the CmpTraceMgr library. Trace objects get their data from a package. A package can contain one or more records. The variable to be recorded is assigned to a record. The PLC_PRG program creates and configures a package and a corresponding record. The FBTracMgr function block encapsulates the functions and handles of the CmpTraceMgr trace manager. The programmatically configured trace can be loaded into a trace object by means of the Trace → Upload Trace command. " },

Creating and importing a client certificate via CSR Create a ( Thing ) device in AWS IoT Core via the web interface. You can view and manage your ( Things ) devices in the navigation side panel under Manage > All Devices > Things . In the sample project, open the AWSPubSub application. Set the endpoint to the AWSIoTClient.sHostname input. Example: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.yyyyyyyy.amazonaws.com) You can find your endpoints in the navigation side panel under Connect > Domain configurations . You can also create a new endpoint there if necessary. Set the previously assigned device name (\"Name of thing\") to the AWSIoTClient.sClientId input. Use the AWSIoTClient.sCertCNPrefix input if the ClientId is identical to the host name. This prevents loading an incorrect certificate (for example from WebServer ). If the input is not displayed, then execute the Reset Pins command. Example: sCertCNPrefix := 'AWSClient', sClientId := 'MyHostname'; The \"Common Name\" (CN) of the certificate is AWSClient@MyHostname Download the application to the controller and start it. The application will now try to establish an encrypted connection to AWS, but it will fail due to the missing certificate. Nevertheless, this setup experiment is relevant in the following. Set the xEnable flag of the AWSIoTClient to TRUE . In the device editor, select the PLC Shell tab. Run the following command: cert-getapplist A component with the specified device name and number is displayed in the output. Note: The device is not displayed if you have not previously attempted to establish a connection to AWS (Step 5). Run the following command: cert-createcsr <number> encoding=Base64 Replace <number> with the number obtained in Step 8. Generating the CSR file may take a few seconds. In the device editor under the Log category, a corresponding message is output after generation. In the device editor, select the Files tab. Copy the CSR file from the cert\/export directory to the local file system. You can now use the generated CSR file to create a certificate via the AWS web interface. You can access a management overview of all your certificates in the navigation side panel via Security > Certificates . Use the Add certificate > Create certificate command to create a new certificate with the exported CSR file. Download the certificate and the root certificate. In CODESYS , click View → Security Screen menu command. Under Own Certificates , install your client certificate. Under Trusted Certificates , install the root certificate. Click Online → Reset Cold and start the application. A new connection attempt by the AWSIoTClient function block will now set the AWSIoTClient.xConnectedToBroker output to TRUE . The connection is established successfully. When you uninstall a certificate created via CSR from a controller, it will no longer work if you reinstall it. The reason for this is that information on the private key is removed during uninstallation, in which case you need to create a new certificate for the device. " },

"body" : "The example uses a greenhouse simulator to show how to use communication with the \"AWS IoT Core\" AWS service via the AWS IoT Core Client SL library. The library is part of the CODESYS IIoT Libraries SL product. The program simulates two greenhouses which read the target values from the cloud and send the actual values to the cloud. The visualization of the \"Observation and control unit\" (OCU) can be used to monitor actual values of the greenhouses and write target values to the greenhouses. The program needs three devices on \"AWS IoT Core\", two for the simulated greenhouses, and one for the control unit. The simulators and the control unit are implemented via function blocks and can be operated independently of each other. In the example, the function blocks are called via a single program. The control unit (OCU) has a visualization to set target values (configuration view) and monitor actual values (observation view). The values are stored in \"AWS IoT Core\" via \"Device Shadows\". A \"Device Shadow\" is a JSON file with the actual and the target values. For more information about \"Device Shadows\", see: AWS IoT Device Shadow service Getting Started Download and install the CODESYS package CODESYS IIoT Libraries SL from the CODESYS Store International . The first thing to do with \"AWS IoT Core\" is to create three devices with classic device shadows ( Greenhouse1 , Greenhouse2 , and GreenhouseControlUnit ) and set up the certificates. For a detailed description of how to use certificates, see the product data sheet of the AWS IoT Core Client SL library. Open the Greenhouse Simulator.project sample project.

It remains there until another state change is triggered. MAIL_PRG : This main program runs through the following seven states: FIRST_START This state becomes active when starting the program. All settings here are assigned with default values. Server addresses and ports are assigned, and memory is reserved for receiving emails. INIT_SERVER Initializes the server with new values (for example, user name and password or other server addresses and ports). SEND_MAIL In this state, an instance of EMAIL_SEND is sent via SMTP by an instance of SERVER . NEW_MAIL The values of the current instance of EMAIL_SEND are reset here and the SENDMAIL VISU visualization is prepared for sending a new email. RECEIVE_MAIL The program fetches new email from the server via POP3. If an unread email exists, then this is saved in EMAIL_RECV . DELETE_MAIL In this state, the currently displayed email is deleted from the server. This is done by means of the message ID. For DELETE_MAIL , the server has to support mail IDs.

"body" : "In addition to Client\/Server communication, communication via the OPC UA Pub\/Sub protocol also provides an additional capability to exchange data between the subscribers of a network in compliance with the rules of the OPC UA Foundation. The structure of the data ( DataSet ) can be freely defined and is agreed in advance between the sender and the receiver. This eliminates the need to transport additional (meta) data. Data is transferred with the help of the OPC UA PubSub SL library via UDP\/IP according to the rules as defined for UADP. A Publisher publishes its data to an unknown number of Subscribers. As a result, the sender and receiver do not know each other. That is why the number of receivers also does not have any repercussions for the sender. A reply to the sender as to whether or not its messages have reached the receivers cannot be sent via the protocol due to the nature of the protocol. If necessary, such a reply has to be managed in an application-specific way. The data is transferred in a binary format according to the rules of the OPC UA Foundation. The OPC UA PubSub SL library handles the conversion of IEC data types into the corresponding OPC UA data types and back. The implementation follows the following profiles: Publisher: PubSub Publisher UADP Periodic Fixed Settings Subscriber: PubSub Subscriber UADP Periodic Fixed Settings The message length is limited to 1,500 bytes (MTU) (Chunked NetworkMessages are not supported). As long as the rules for a Time Sensitive Network is still not available, hard real-time conditions cannot be complied with. However, the implementation of the OPC UA PubSub SL library attempts to keep the jitter as low as possible. The library includes the following function blocks: DataSet : Defines a DataSet message Configuration : Manages shared resources, such as Connection or Group RootDiagnostics : Notifies with superordinate diagnostic data Connection : Manages the connection to Publisher and Subscriber ConnectionDiagnostics : Notifies with diagnostic data about the connection ( Connection ) ReaderGroup : Manages Reader function blocks (creation of a NetworkMessage from DataSet messages) ReaderGroupDiagnostics : Notifies with diagnostic data about the ReaderGroup Reader : Manages the DataSet function block (Subscriber) ReaderDiagnostics : Notifies with diagnostic data about a Reader function block WriterGroup : Manages Writer function blocks (creation of a NetworkMessage from DataSet messages) WriterGroupDiagnostics : Notifies with diagnostic data about the WriterGroup Writer : Manages a DataSet function block (Publisher) WriterDiagnostics : Notifies with diagnostic data about a Writer function block Supported functionality Publish\/Subscribe of messages according to OPC 10000-14: OPC Unified Architecture Part 14: PubSub Release 1.04 Maximum size of a NetworkMessage: 1,500 bytes The current packet size and payload can be configured by means of the configuration of the respective ReaderGroup\/WriterGroup and DataSet function blocks.

Define which slots, I\/Os, and parameters are directly part of the macro module. For example, it is possible to hide slots or to reserve them automatically. Frequently recurring constellations of tree connections can be combined into one module. When the macro module is inserted, the entire assembly and the parameterization of the entire subtree are done by the CODESYS Application Composer . In the example, the visualization is already extended by one macro module. To use this, you need to create and instantiate the RoomUnitMacro_OneLightOneInverter macro module as a module from the Room2 instance. This macro module should include the constellation \"one room with one light and one switch\". After a generation cycle by the CODESYS Application Composer , you can then use the application with the visualization. Another application example is the draft in the form of subtrees of two different control settings for a motor. For example, while one control setting is responsible for low overshoot, the other one could primarily follow the target in order to achieve the specified value as fast as possible. Both subtrees with parameter sets could each be combined within one macro module. When creating the module tree, you can then use the desired control module without having to complete all of the subtree configuration or without even seeing the subtree. " },

The lights (blinking or steady) can be linked to switches or -buttons. A switch or-button can be linked to several lights. For example, if a light is equipped with both a switch and buttons, then the switch behaves as a main switch which must be pressed before the lights can be operated with the push-buttons. If only switches are installed, then these switch the referencing light. A blinking light automatically switches between on and off when it is switched on. In the example, the decoupled module describes a shed which is applied both as part of the house and as a top-level module. The application of the shed can be executed on a separate controller, regardless of its use. The sample project includes the following: Module declarations Function block declarations Device tree Module tree For more information, see: Decoupled section and Proxies section. To generate this example, the Standard generator option must be selected. In order to communicate with the different controllers, the application target of the shed must be set accordingly in the instances of the shed. Three interconnected controllers are required for executing this sample application. For example, the CODESYS Control Win (SoftPLC) product can be used as a second and third controller on a configured virtual machine. If the decoupled module is applied as a submodule but it runs on a separate controller, then the communication takes place via the list of network variables and proxy instances. " },

"body" : "In the example, a short scenario from building automation is implemented: equip a room with lights and corresponding switches. The switches can also be used as dimmers. Therefore, the lights should also support different brightness levels. Preparatory work Create a new CODESYS project from the Standard project with Application Composer template. Select AC_ModuleBase as the library. The top-level module Room Add a new module declaration to the POU pool of the project. Assign the name Room to the module declaration and the associated function block. The function block must also extend the AC.Module function block which is defined in the AC_ModuleBase library. The AC.Module function block already provides numerous methods and properties which do not have to be overwritten. The declaration starts with the keyword MODULE followed by the module name and the additional keyword IMPLEMENTED_BY , as well as by the function block which implements the module. Specifically, this function block is the Room function block which has just been created. In most cases, the MetaData section is declared now. For detailed information about all parameters and sections, see: Module editor . Because the Room module is the top-level module in our example, you declare the Toplevel section next. In this section, you define a name for the global variable list which contains the instance name of the top-level function block after being generated. After that, you still need to define at least one more task in the Toplevel section. This task is Standard_Task in this example. It is defined as a MEDIUM task and contains the CREATE_IF_MISSING and UPDATE_IOS flags. All icons and strings which are used as placeholders for the descriptions and icons ( Desc , Icon_16 , and Icon_32 parameters) must be referenced in text lists and image pools. Because of this, you create a corresponding text list TL and an image pool IP in the POU pool which contains the referenced icons and texts. Submodule: Switch Create a module declaration and a corresponding function block named Switch . This module is not a top-level module and therefore does not require a Toplevel section. Like all function blocks that represent modules, the Switch function block must also extend AC.modules . Moreover, Switch implements the ISwitch interface which you also need to create. In turn, the ISwitch interface extends AC.IModule but does not add any new methods or properties to it. Furthermore, the switch requires an input signal in order to recognize when it is pressed. You declare this signal in the IO section, using the xIn input variable of the Switch function block. Furthermore, you need a reference time to distinguish the two functions of the switch: Pressing the switch for the time duration tTimer starts the dimming function – a shorter press only switches the light on or off. You define the input variable tTimer as a parameter of the module ( Parameters section). In this way, you can easily set the time later when using the modules. You define the variables xIn and tTimer as inputs of the Switch function block, where you set an initial value of 500ms for the tTimer parameter. You also need to extend the text list and image pool in oder to display the descriptions. Submodule: SwitchSimple The second switch module which you create is a simple switch with only two states: on and off. To do this, you need to create a module declaration and a function block which differ from the existing switch only in the following points: the parameter and the tTimer variable are not required. In addition, you do not implement ISwitch but ISwitchSimple , which also extends AC.IModule . Submodule: Light As before for the switches, for the light you also need to create a module declaration Light with the Light function block and ILight interface. To insert the Light module below a room, you need to add the Slots section to the Light module declaration. In this section, you declare a subsection Slot_Multi , which you call Lights and which can hold the modules of type ILight . The number of lights that must or can be added to a room is specified by Cardinality . You also define the variables Variable and Var_Count and link these to the module declaration pLights(POINTER TO ILight) and uiNumberOfLights (UINT) . This makes sure that only modules whose function blocks implement the ILight interface can be added to the Lights slot. With the Light module, you also define a slot where a switch can be inserted. Therefore, you need to add a Switch slot to the Light module declaration. Additional parameters of the Light module are the speed of the dimmer rSpeed and the maximum brightness uiMaxValue . Finally, you need to define an output which represents the brightness of the light. You need to add all parameters, slots, and outputs, as well as variables for the Light function block. Submodule: LightSimple The last module you create is a simplified light which works with the simple switch. To do this, you need a module declaration and a LightSimple function block which extends AC.Module and implements the existing ILight interface. The differences from the Light module are as follows: the output should be of type BOOL and have the name xSwitchedOn . In addition, the rSpeed parameter is not required. Implementation For the implementation of the function for the Switch module, use the CallPrioMediumStart method from AC.Module and override it with its own implementation. This function is selected because the Room top-level module declares a MEDIUM task. This means that the CallPrioMediumStart method of the Switch function block is automatically called in every cycle of the task. However, the main feature of the switch is differentiating between switching on\/off and dimming. After pressing the switch, a timer starts with a time which can preset with user parameters. When the timer has elapsed and the switch is still pressed, the dimmer function is applied, which is represented by the variable xPushLong . The variable xPush is TRUE when the switch is pressed only for a short time. For both variables xPushLong and xPush , properties are added in both the Switch function block and the interface so that they can be used from the parent light function block. Also the Light function block overrides the CallPrioMediumStart method. Depending on the value of the respective input variables, the light is either dimmed or simply switched on\/off. For the dimmer, the speed value of the declared parameter rSpeed is used. After the maximum or minimum dim value has been reached, the dimming is stopped. If the light is in a dimmed state and the switch is pressed, then the light is switched on. You can see a possible implementation in the sample project. Engineering You create the module tree in the Modules view. To do this, first add the Room top-level module to the module tree after the modules have been imported. In the Lights slot, add one Light and one LightSimple . To each of these, assign a Switch or a SwitchSimple . Then you can set the parameters and I\/Os of the module instances. For testing purposes, it is advisable to link the inputs and outputs to variables in a global variable list. Finally, use the Composer → Create command to create the project. After downloading to a device, you can test the example however you want. You can also vary the layout of the room without having to modify the code or the modules. You can also modify the values of the module instance parameters and check their effects. The parameter values can be changed both offline and online. " },

If only switches are installed, then these switch the referencing light. A blinking light automatically switches between on and off when it is switched on. In the example, the entire communication network is designed to be flexible so that both fieldbus devices and the type of fieldbuses is determined by wildcard mapping. This makes it possible to replace the entire fieldbus or just individual parts. The sample project includes the following: Module declarations Function block declarations Device tree Module tree (1): Mapping of the demand properties of the device For more information, see: Device Generator section. By using flexible wildcards, it is necessary to map the installed devices to the last wildcards, which are nothing more than placeholders for specific device types. This is done during wildcard mapping before generator cycle by the CODESYS Application Composer . When the device generator is activated, the application code can be generated, including all necessary devices. You can automatically implement module I\/Os using properties which are mapped to the channels of the devices. For this purpose, available matching properties of device channels are linked automatically to module I\/Os. The applied properties are saved for each device description and define, if necessary, their own demand on properties. Flexible and static device generation can be used simultaneously, for example if part of the devices is already known. Determining specific hardware will limit the flexibility of the device generator. After the bus system has been generated for the first time, you may need to adapt the communication settings. In this case, you can ignore the warning that you should not modify any files created by the CODESYS Application Composer . If no changes were made to the tree of module instances, then the following configuration of the communication system is possible: Fieldbus: EtherCAT Master Bus coupler: EK1100 Terminal input: EL1008 Terminal output: EL2004 The selected configuration can be changed at any time by means of the Wildcard selection menu item of the CODESYS Application Composer and generating again.

"body" : "The AC_Mechatronics.library library provides an OMAC program manager (simple) which is based on the OMAC State Model ( www.omac.org ). The program manager allows for different states of the OMAC State Model, each to be equipped and displayed with a sequence. To use the AC_Mechatronics.library library, you need to create modules which are inserted in the program sequences of the library. These program sequences are parameterized and instantiated in the sequence editor. If you want to use module sequence steps in a program sequence, then they must implement the AC_MEC.IProgramSequenceStep interface. Details about the AC_Mechatronics.library library: If a sequence step should be used in a program sequence, then the StepBase module is the easiest way to extend it. In this way, the step directly implements AC_MEC.IProgramSequenceStep and can be used in program sequences. Within the extension of StepBase , the Execute method must be overridden, which you can see in this example. The Execute method of the currently active step is executed and called until this step signals the end of its task by setting the Done property to TRUE . The AC_Mechatronics.library library already provides some basic steps. This includes, for example, sequence steps which represent jumps ( ConditionalJump ) or branches ( BranchOnBool , BranchOnComparison ). Within the scope of the AC_Mechatronics. library, it is possible for sequence steps to act on the actuator modules which they reference. A slot is provided for actuators below an AC_Mechatronics.library machine (top-level module in this library). In order to insert them there, the actuators must implement the empty AC_MEC.IActuator interface. Below the machine (module defined in AC_Mechatronics.library ), there is a slot for a program manager module which contains the OMAC state behavior. Sequences for each OMAC state can be inserted below the program manager module. The Program Manager module has inputs and outputs to control the OMAC states (for example, to send a start or stop command to the program manager). Compare with the OMAC diagram. " },

In addition, the I\/Os of the modules can be mapped to the inputs and outputs of the respective device (hardware), and therefore linked automatically by the CODESYS Application Composer . This results in the following function blocks and interfaces: " },

The decision as to whether or not a pupil can learn a particular subject is up to the pupil. Therefore, a functioning module configuration always has to consist of a teacher, at least one pupil, and at least one subject. Considering the architecture of the AC_ModuleTeaching library, the following design results: The TeacherModule , SubjectModule , and PupilModule (or TeacherRegistration ) function blocks derive from the AC.Module function block. This allows these three module types to be configured in a module tree. Only two function blocks are relevant for the implementation of learnable modules: SubjectModule and PupilModule .

In ReportTeacher() , Report(THIS^) of the TeacherModule is called implicitly. The TeacherModule provides the SubjectModule interface to all PupilModule instances via Learn(ISubject) with the possibility of learning the SubjectModule .
