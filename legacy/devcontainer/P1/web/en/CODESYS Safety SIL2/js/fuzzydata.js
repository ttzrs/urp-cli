An application login is possible only in the following cases: \"SAFE RUN\" mode: The active application has been downloaded and is running as a \"safe load\" boot application.

There are two options for this: If the manufacturer of the controller offers external events for the standard application which can be synchronized with the tasks of the safety application, then the tasks of the standard application can be defined as \"External Event Tasks\". This makes the time behavior deterministic. Independent of this, simple \"Event Tasks\" can also be used in the standard application which use event variables of the safety application, which are provided via the EVC.

Device scan \/ communication In the default Compound Safety PLC, the handling for device scan and communication differs slightly from that of a standard PLC. Device scan for a Compound Safety PLC The Compound Safety PLC has one root PLC, and only this PLC is able and responsible for performing the device scan. To scan the Compound Safety PLC, use the Communication Settings of the root PLC (similar to a standard CODESYS PLC). NOTE: In the subdevices, there is no Communication Settings tab. If the device scan was successful and an \"active path\" is set for the root PLC, then you see a message in the Messages view which confirms that the communication settings for the subdevices have been automatically set in the background. Connecting to the PLC The subdevices of a Compound Safety PLC are independent PLCs, except with regard to the communication settings or the EVLs or EVCs. This means that online services such as \"application download\", \"start application\", \"enter debug mode\" and so on are specific to the selected subdevice (by the \"active application\").

Example of an EVC If the application of the safe subdevice is not up-to-date (if the application was changed after the last successful code generation), then the EVC editor displays a warning similar to the following: Safe application has changed or is not up to date. Execute \"Build\" command to be able to select variables. If you want to generate code for the safe application directly, then you can use the Build button. Afterwards, the warning should disappear. All variables found within the safety application of the safety subdevice are displayed in the EVC editor in a structured way.

These function blocks are certified and as a result reduce the time and costs in the development, verification, and acceptance of a safety application. Similar to a logical wiring, the blocks can be linked to each other by logical operations. Thus, important components of a safety application can be created quickly and without much programming effort.

The second horizontal line shows the transition from a non-safe state to a safe state of the FB. The priorities of possible parallel transitions are indicated by numbers ( 0 = highest priority). State bubbles contain the state name and hexadecimal DiagCode. Conditions OR , AND , and XOR are used as logical operators and NOT is used as negation. Within the FB description, the starting state is Idle , with the transitions to operational states via the Init state. The transition from any state due to Activate = FALSE changes directly to the Idle state ( 0 = highest priority reserved for Activate = FALSE ).

The function block output shows the result of the evaluation of both channels. If S_AntivalentOut = TRUE and one of the safety-related inputs changes, then the output immediately switches to FALSE .
